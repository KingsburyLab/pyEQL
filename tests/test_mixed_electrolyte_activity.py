"""
pyEQL test suite for mixed electrolyte activity
===============================================

This file contains tests for the Effective Pitzer Model
implemented in pyEQL.

This test suite creates several mixed salt solutions and compares
pyEQL's calculations with experimental data for activity coefficients
and/or osmotic coefficients.

The Effective Pitzer Model is described in Mistry et al.
DOI: 10.1016/j.desal.2013.03.015

Experimental data for mixed electrolytes is obtained from Rodil et al.
DOI: 10.1021/je9004432
