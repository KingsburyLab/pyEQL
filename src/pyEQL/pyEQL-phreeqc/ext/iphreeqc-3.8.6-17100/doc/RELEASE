Version 3.8.6: January  7, 2025

	-----------------
	January 7, 2025
	-----------------
	PHREEQC: Refactored github actions to test CMake build based on autotools
	distribution.

	-----------------
	January 4, 2025
	-----------------
	PHREEQC: Fixed examples to have fewer warnings. Fixed headers of 
	some database files. Changed some output from warnings to comments.

	-----------------
	January 3, 2025
	-----------------
	PHREEQC: Fixed version and date string replacements in source distribution.


Version 3.8.5: November 20, 2024

	-----------------
	November 15, 2024
	-----------------
	PhreeqcRM: Fixed a bug when the diffuse-layer disappeared in a PhreeqcRM calculation
	with a Runge-Kutta integration and the rate went to zero. The error produced charge 
	imbalance because the surface transformed to a no-EDL surface; charge accumulated
	on the surface and was balanced by an opposite charge imbalance in the solution. 

	-----------------
	November 13, 2024
	-----------------
	PHREEQCI: Resolved a bug that caused a buffer overflow and led to PHREEQCI
	freezing when loaded under the Simplified Chinese locale.
	
	-----------------
	November 11, 2024
	-----------------
	PHREEQC: Added a new keyword data block GAS_BINARY_PARAMETERS that define 
	binary interaction coefficients for pairs of gas components. PHREEQC retains
	some hard-coded interaction parameters, but these can be modified, and new 
	interaction parameters can be added with the new data block. The following 
	data block gives the hard-coded values in PHREEQC:
		GAS_BINARY_PARAMETERS
		H2O(g)  CO2(g)           0.19
		H2O(g)  H2S(g)           0.19
		H2O(g)  H2Sg(g)          0.19
		H2O(g)  CH4(g)           0.49
		H2O(g)  Mtg(g)           0.49
		H2O(g)  Methane(g)       0.49
		H2O(g)  N2(g)            0.49
		H2O(g)  Ntg(g)           0.49
		H2O(g)  Ethane(g)        0.49
		H2O(g)  Propane(g)       0.55

	-----------------
	November 7, 2024
	-----------------
	PhreeqcRM: Fixed a bug when multiple PhreeqcRM instances were created in Fortran
	with debug compilation. Some debugging code caused a failure if the instances did
	not have the same number of cells. 
	
	-----------------
	November 1, 2024
	-----------------
	Phreeqc: Updated H+ and Br- viscosity in Amm.dat, phreeqc.dat, phreeqc_rates.dat, and pitzer.dat.
	Small change to basicsubs.cpp. 

	-----------------
	October 24, 2024
	-----------------
	IPhreeqc: Updated IPhreeqc unit tests.

Version 3.8.3: October 22, 2024

	-----------------
	October 8, 2024
	-----------------
	PHREEQC: Revised the multicomponent diffusion calculation of heat and solutes, 
	accounting now for the heat also for the T-dependent viscosity of the solutions.
	
	-----------------
	October 8, 2024
	-----------------
	PHREEQC: Corrected spelling errors throughout PHREEQC as supplied by Mike Toews.
	Modified "lamda" to "lambda" internally as suggested by Toews, but "lamda" and 
	"lambda" are both acceptable in Pitzer database files for backward compatibility.

	-----------------
	October 8, 2024
	-----------------
	PHREEQC: Fixed  bug in MIX that produced erroneous temperature and pressure
	if the solutions being mixed did not have 1 kg of water. (Note that PHREEQC does 
	not consider the heat content of the solutions when the temperature of the mixture 
	is calculated.)
	

Version 3.8.2: August 29, 2024

	-----------------
	August 27, 2024
	-----------------
	Added variable "viscos_DDL" in EDL("viscos_DDL", "surface_name") to give the
	viscosity of a Donnan layer on a surface in BASIC. Note that the "surface_name"
	should not contain an underscore "_", the Donnan properties are for the surface,
	not for surface charge, thus use the surface name "Hfo", not "Hfo_w". If
	"surface_name" is omitted, the viscosity is given for the first surface in the
	alphabetical order.

	The viscosity of the Donnan layer on a surface is printed now in the output file.

	The viscosity calculation was adapted for high concentrations of neutral species
	and gases. Viscosity parameters for CO2 were added using data from McBride et
	al., 2015, JCED 60, 171-180. See example c:\phreeqc\viscosity\CO2.phr.

Version 3.8.1: August 23, 2024

	-----------------
	August 20, 2024
	-----------------
	PhreeqcRM (Python): Expanded documentation in BMI Python example notebook for
	PHREEQC example 11 (ex11-advect.ipynb), courtesy of LimnoTech.
	
	-----------------
	August 14, 2024
	-----------------
	IPhreeqc: Pull request for modifications of class definition order and header file to 
	accommodate Clang 15 on Mac.

	-----------------
	August 13, 2024
	-----------------
	IPhreeqc: This resolves an issue when building shared libraries (DLLs) on Windows with
	BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON and BUILD_TESTING=ON enabled in CMake.

	Sets BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF when building the googletest framework.
	Adds ctest-shared.cmake for testing shared library builds.

	It also resolves a build error that occurred when building shared libraries (DLLs) on
	Windows using the Ninja generator.

	Adds the _WINDLL preprocessor definition for shared Windows builds.
	
	-----------------
	August 8, 2024
	-----------------
	PhreeqcRM (Python): Fixed one docstring. Added code to handle numpy arrays 
	in yamlphreeqc.
	
	-----------------
	July 11, 2024
	-----------------
	PHREEQC: Fixed a bug in the DUMP routines. Under some circumstances
	erroneous output was dumped for a user number.  In most cases, the
	correct output was dumped following the erroneous output, which
	caused the erroneous output to be ignored.
	
Version 3.8.0: July  3, 2024

	-----------------
	May 18, 2024
	-----------------
	DATABASES:
	sit.dat was updated to version 12a (Aug 22, 2023) from www.thermochimie-tdb.com.

	Amm.dat, iso.dat, llnl.dat, minteq.dat, minteq.v4.dat, phreeqc.dat, 
	phreeqc_rates.dat, pitzer.dat. Tipping_Hurley.dat, and wateq4f.dat were 
	reformatted by using the lsp utility by David Kinniburgh from phreeplot.org.

	-----------------
	May 3, 2024
	-----------------
	PHREEQC: The -dw identifier of SOLUTION_SPECIES now has up to 7 items.
	
	-dw Dw(25C) dw_T a a2 visc a3 a_v_dif  
	
	where,
	Dw(25C)--Tracer diffusion coefficient for the species at 25 °C, m 2 /s. 
	dw_T--Temperature dependence for diffusion coefficient.
	a--Debye-Hückel ion size.
	a2--exponent.
	Visc--Viscosity exponent.
	a3--Ionic strength exponent.
	A_v_dif--Exponent for (viscosity_0/viscosity).
	
	The diffusion coefficient is calculated as follows:
	Dw = Dw(25C) * exp(dw_T / T - dw_T / 298.15)
	ka = DH_B * a2 * I0.5/ (1 + a3)
	av = (viscos_0/viscos)a_v_diff
	ff = av * exp(-a * DH_A * z * I0.5 / (1 + ka))
	Dw = Dw * ff
	Where T is temperature in Kelvin, DH_B is the Debye-Hückel B parameter, 
	I is ionic strength, viscos_0 is the viscosity of pure water at T, viscos is 
	the viscosity of the solution at T, DH_A is the Debye-Hückel A parameter,
	and z is the charge on the species,the viscosity of the solution. 
	See Robinson and Stokes, 2002, Chpt 11 for examples. 
	The Dw and a_v_dif can be set in a USER_ program with 
	setdiff_c("name", Dw, a_v_dif), for example: 
	  10 print setdiff_c("H+", 9.31e-9, 1). 
	The diffusion coefficient of H+ is handled differently with 
	Falkenhagen equations. 

	-----------------
	May 3, 2024
	-----------------
	PHREEQC: The ionic strength correction is for electromigration calculations 
	(Appelo, 2017, CCR 101, 102). The correction is applied when the 6th parameter
	option is set to true for -multi_D in TRANSPORT:
	
	-multi_d true/false 1e-9 0.3 0.05 1.0 true/false # multicomponent diffusion
	
	true/false, multicomponent diffusion is used,
	default tracer diffusion coefficient (used in case -dw is not defined for a species), 
	porosity (por = 0.3), 
	limiting porosity (0.05) below which diffusion stops, 
	exponent n (1.0) used in calculating the effect of tortuosity on the 
	porewater diffusion coefficient	Dp = Dw * por^n, 
	true/false: correct Dw for ionic strength (false by default). 
	
	-----------------
	May 3, 2024
	-----------------
	Database: Added new database phreeqc_rates.dat. The database augments
	phreeqc.dat with rate parameters from Palandri and Kharaka (2004),
	Sverdrup, Oelkers, Lampa, Belyazid, Kurz, and Akselsson (2019) (only 
	Albite and quartz), and Hermanska, Voigt, Marieni, Declercq, 
	and Oelkers (2023). Parameters are defined in data blocks
	RATE_PARAMETERS_PK, RATE_PARAMETERS_SVD, and RATE_PARAMETERS_HERMANSKA.
	All minerals with rate parameters have been added in a PHASES
	data block. Example RATES definitions using the different RATE_PARAMETERS_
	parameters are provided for Albite and Quartz. 

	-----------------
	April 27, 2024
	-----------------
	Databases: Added new keyword data block MEAN_GAMMAS. Each line 
	of the data block defines how to calculate the mean activity
	coefficient for a salt with a series of pairs of 
	aqueous species and stoichiometric coefficient. Phreeqc.dat, 
	Amm.dat, pitzer.dat, and phreeqc_rates.dat have this data block.
	
	MEAN_GAMMAS
	MgCl2  Mg+2 1 Cl 2
	
	A new Basic function MEANG will calculate mean activity coefficients
	for salts listed in the MEAN_GAMMAS data block.
	
	10 g_MgCl2 = MEANG("MgCl2")
	
	
	-----------------
	April 27, 2024
	-----------------
	PHREEQC: Added new keyword data blocks RATE_PARAMETERS_PK, RATE_PARAMETERS_SVD,
	and RATE_PARAMETERS_HERMANSKA and Basic functions RATE_PK, RATE_SVD, and
	RATE_HERMANSKA

	Three rate equations from Palandri and Kharaka (2004) can be entered. Most minerals use
	use the first form above with 8 parameters. Table 33 has a term for CO2 as in 
	the calcite example above; parameters from table 33 are identified with a 33 in the 9th
	field following 8 parameters. Table 35 has additional terms and data from this table
	is identified with 35 in field 11 following 10 rate parameters. The rates for the

	-----------------
	April 21, 2024
	-----------------
	PHREEQC: Added Basic functions GET$ and PUT$. They are are the same as
	GET and PUT, except the first argument for PUT$ is a character string, 
	and GET$ returns a character string. You may use one or more indices as
	needed to identify the value that is saved (PUT$) or retrieved (GET$).
	
	PUT$("MgCl2", 1, 1, 1)
	x$ = GET$(1, 1, 1)

	-----------------
	April 19, 2024
	-----------------
	DATABASE: Kinec.v2.dat is a new llnl.dat style database from the 
	CarbFix2 and GECO projects that is included in new distributions of 
	PHREEQC. This database contains the parameters for calculating mineral 
	dissolution rates for primary and secondary silicate minerals using the 
	equations and parameters reported by Hermanska et al. (2022, 2023)  
	and dissolution rates for other non-silicate mineral systems using the 
	equations and parameters reported by Oelkers and Addassi (2024, in 
	preparation).

	-----------------
	April 15, 2024
	-----------------
	PHREEQC: Fixed a memory error with iso.dat because it uses H3O+ instead of 
	H+. The SC variable was uninitialized in that situation.
	
	DATABASES: Amm.dat, phreeqc.dat, and pitzer.dat were updated with 
	revisions to viscosity and specific conductance.
	
	PhreeqcRM and IPhreeqc: Fixed bug with the temperature grid for llnl. Some 
	internal testing and list generators used the default temperature of 25C, 
	which caused an error if the temperature grid did not span 25C.
	
	-----------------
	March 25, 2024
	-----------------
	DATABASES phreeqc.dat, Amm.dat, and pitzer.dat: The calculation of the 
	specific conductance can now be done with a Debye-Hückel-Onsager equation 
	that has both the electrophoretic and the relaxation term. (The standard 
	phreeqc calculation uses a simple electrophoretic term only.) For 
	individual ions, the equation can be multiplied with the viscosity ratio of 
	the solvent and the solution, and the ion-size a in the Debye-Hückel term 
	kappa_a can be made a function of the apparent molar volume of the ion. The 
	options are described and used in the databases. The additions extend the 
	applicability of the DHO equation to concentrations in the molar range, 
	reducing AARD (average of the absolute relative deviations) for SC and 
	transference numbers to less than 1% in many cases. For high KHCO3 
	concentrations, the SCs indicate the presence of a KHCO3 complex that was 
	added to phreeqc.dat and Amm.dat. The AARD's are 0.18 % for NaCl, 0.48 % 
	for KCl, 0.51 % for MgCl2 and 0.89 % for CaCl2. More example files are 
	available at http://hydrochemistry.eu.  
	
	PHREEQC Bug-fix: Option -density c[alculate] in SOLUTION_SPREAD was 
	corrected to give the iterated density of the solutions. 
	
	PHREEQC: A new option has been added. The viscosity of the EDL 
	layer on SURFACE(s) can now be calculated and will then be used to 
	modify the diffusion coefficients. It is set by adding c(alculate) 
	after viscosity, for example, "-donnan 1e-8 viscosity calc". 
	
	PHREEQC Bug-fix: Viscosity of the EDL layer on SURFACE(s), defined with, for 
	example, "-donnan 1e-8 viscosity 3", was omitted in Version 3.4.2. It is 
	now re-introduced in the calculations. 
	
	PHREEQC Bug-fix: Basic now returns the contributions to the specific conductance 
	(t_sc("H+")) and the viscosity (f_visc("H+")) only when the species is present 
	in the solution. In previous versions a dummy value was returned when the 
	species was predefined, but absent in the actual solution calculation. 
	
	PHREEQC Bug-fix: Limits for fugacity coefficients were set to be 0.01 < phi < 85 in 
	Peng-Robinson calculations. The limits were removed in version 3.7 (when calculating 
	H2S(g) solubilities). However, without the limits, all water turned into H2O(g) in some 
	cases and calculations failed. 
	
	-----------------
	November 15, 2023
	-----------------
	PHREEQC programs: Fixed a couple malloc checks, some compiler warnings, and removed
	some deprecated calls to strcpy and strcat.
	
	-----------------
	November 5, 2023
	-----------------
	PHREEQC programs: Automatic testing was expanded to include MPI and additional compilers.

	-----------------
	November 1, 2023
	-----------------
	PHREEQC: Logical statement in k_temp was modified to work with Intel optimization.
	The statement at the beginning of the routine was not handled correctly when some 
	values were NaN. 

	-----------------
	August 29, 2023
	-----------------
	PhreeqcRM: Fixed bug in memory allocation for selected output. One array accumulated lines 
	indefinitely, leading to ever increasing memory use. Memory use should now be relatively
	constant once all selected output has been defined and used. 

	-----------------
	June 1, 2023
	-----------------	
	PhreeqcRM: Finalizing a Python version of PhreeqcRM that includes the BMI capabilities.
	Methods are documented in Python style and two test cases are available, one
	of which uses every Python method that is available. 

	-----------------
	May 22, 2023
	-----------------
	PhreeqcRM: Revised all F90 methods that return arrays to use allocatable arrays,
	so that, getter arrays are automatically dimensioned to the correct sizes
		
	-----------------
	May 22, 2023
	-----------------
	PHREEQC: (See https://hydrochemistry.eu/ph3/release.html for html version of changes.)
	Added Basic function f_visc("H+") that returns the fractional contribution of a species to 
	viscosity of the solution when parameters are defined for the species with -viscosity. 
	Actually, it gives the contribution of the species to the B and D terms in the Jones-Dole 
	equation, assuming that the A term is small. The fractional contribution can be negative, for
	example f_visc("K+") is usually less than zero.
	
	Bug-fix: When -Vm parameters of SOLUTION_SPECIES were read after -viscosity parameters, the 
	first viscosity parameter was set to 0.

	Defined -analytical_expression and -gamma for Na2SO4, K2SO4 and MgSO4 and Mg(SO4)2-2 species in 
	phreeqc.dat and Amm.dat, fitting the activities from pitzer.dat from 0-200 °C, and the solubilities of 
	mirabilite/thenardite (Na2SO4), arcanite (K2SO4), and epsomite, hexahydrite, kieserite (MgSO4 
	and new species Mg(SO4)2-2). The parameters for calculating the apparent volume (-Vm) and the 
	diffusion coefficients (-Dw) of the species were adapted using measured data of density and 
	conductance (SC). Example files are available at http://hydrochemistry.eu

	Removed the NaCO3- species in PHREEQC.dat since it is not necessary for the calculation of 
	the specific conductance (SC) and its origin is unknown. 
	
	Defined parameters in the -analytical_expression, -gamma, -dw, -Vm and -viscosity for 
	the NaHCO3 species in phreeqc.dat and Amm.dat, using the data in Appelo, 2015, Appl. Geochem. 
	55, 62-71. (These data were used for defining interaction parameters in 
	pitzer.dat.) The parameters for the apparent volume (-Vm), the 	diffusion 
	coefficient (-Dw) and the viscosity of CO3-2 and HCO3- were adapted using measured 	
	data of density, conductance and viscosity of binary solutions.

	The viscosity of the solution at P, T is now calculated and printed in the output file, and can 
	be retrieved in Basic programs with the function viscos (in previous versions, viscos returned 
	the viscosity of pure water at P, T).

	The calculation uses a modified Jones-Dole equation which sums the contributions of individual 
	solutes:

		eta / eta0 = 1 + A sqrt(0.5 sum(zi*mi)) + sum fan (Bi*mi + Di*mi*ni),
		
	where eta is the viscosity of the solution (mPa s), eta0 is viscosity of pure water at the 
	temperature and pressure of the solution, mi is the molality of species i, made dimensionless 
	by dividing by 1 molal, and zi is the absolute charge number. A is derived from Debye-Hückel 
	theory, and fan, B, D and n are coefficients that incorporate volume, ionic strength and 
	temperature effects. 
	
	The coefficients are:

		B = b0 + b1 exp(-b2 tC)
		
	where b0, b1, and b2 are coefficients, and tC is the temperature in °C. The temperature is 
	limited to 200 °C.

		fan = (2 - tan * Van / VCl-)
		
	for anions, with tan a coefficient and Van the P, T and I dependent, apparent volume of the 
	anion relative to the one of Cl-, which is used as reference species. For cations, fan = 1 
	and tan need not be defined.

		D = d1 exp(-d2 tC)
	where d1 and d2 are coefficients.

		n = ((1 + fI)^d3 + ((zi^2 + zi) / 2 * mi)^d3 / (2 + fI)
		
	where fI averages ionic strength effects and d3 is a coefficient.
	
	The coefficients are fitted on measured viscosities of binary solutions and entered 
	with item -viscosity under keyword SOLUTION_SPECIES, for example for H+:

		  SOLUTION_SPECIES
		  H+ = H+
		  -viscosity 9.35e-2 -8.31e-2 2.487e-2 4.49e-4 2.01e-2 1.570    0
		  #           b0       b1       b2      d1       d2      d3     tan
		  
	When the solute concentrations are seawater-like or higher, the viscosity is different 
	from pure water (see figure at). To obtain a valid model for natural waters with phreeqc.dat, 
	the complexes of SO42- with the major cations were redefined, as noted above.
	The A parameter in the Jones-Dole equation needs temperature dependent diffusion coefficients 
	of the species, and therefore the parameters for calculating the I and T dependency of the 
	diffusion coefficients (-dw parameters of SOLUTION_SPECIES) were refitted for SO42- and CO32- 
	species. Example files are available at http://hydrochemistry.eu.

	Implicit calculations with option -fix_current will now account for changing concentrations in 
	the boundary solutions of the column.

	Activated the print of statements defined in USER_PRINT when the initial EXCHANGE, SURFACE and 
	GAS_PHASE are calculated.

	Changed the dw_t parameter for CO3-2 to 30 (was 0) and for HCO3- to -150 (was 0) to better fit 
	McCleskey's data

	Bug fix: removed the factor (TK / 298.15) from the calculation of the temperature dependence of 
	the diffusion coefficient. For an example, see the calculation of Dw(TK) of H+ in the next 
	paragraph.

	Bug fixes in printing/punching of diffusion coefficients with diff_c and setdiff_c: the numbers 
	are now corrected for I and T effects when the appropriate factors are defined in keyword 
	SOLUTION_SPECIES, item -dw. For example:

	H+ = H+
		-gamma 9.0 0
		-dw 9.31e-9 1000 0.46 1e-10 # The dw parameters are defined in Appelo, 2017, CCR 101, 102-113.

	It will set Dw(TK) = 9.31e-9 * exp(1000 / TK - 1000 / 298.15) * viscos_0_25 / viscos_0_tc
	and Dw(I) = Dw(TK) * exp(-0.46 * DH_A * |zi| * I 0.5 / (1 + DH_B * I 0.5 * 1e-10 / (1 + I 0.75))),

	where viscos_0_25 is the viscosity of pure water at 25 °C, viscos_0_tc is the viscosity of pure 
	water at the temperature of the solution. DH_A and DH_B are Debye-Hückel parameters, 
	retrievable with PHREEQC Basic.


	The temperature correction is always applied in multicomponent, diffusive transport and for 
	calculating the viscosity.

	The ionic strength correction is for electromigration calculations (Appelo, 2017, CCR 101, 102). 
	The correction is applied when the option is set true in TRANSPORT, item -multi_D:
		-multi_d true 1e-9 0.3 0.05 1.0 true # multicomponent diffusion
		
	# true/false, default tracer diffusion coefficient (Dw = 1e-9 m2/s) in water at 25 °C (used in 
	case -dw is not defined for a species), porosity (por = 0.3), limiting porosity (0.05) below 
	which diffusion stops, exponent n (1.0) used in calculating the porewater diffusion coefficient 
	Dp = Dw * por^n, true/false: correct Dw for ionic strength (false by default).

	PhreeqcRM:
	Changed documentation of GetDensity and related functions to GetDensityCalculated. 
		(GetDensity still exists for backward compatibility.)
	Changed documentation of SetDensity and related functions to SetDensityUser. 
		(SetDensity still exists for backward compatibility.)
	
	Density is used to convert user-model concentrations to module solution definitions only if the
	units of the user-model concentrations are specified to be parts per million. The density specified by 
	SetDensityUser is used by SetConcentrations to convert from per kg of solution to 
	per L of solution. For GetConcentrations, two options are available to convert from module solutions 
	to user-model concentrations, depending on the value used for the method SetUseSolutionDensityVolume: 
	(1) the module-calculated density is used to convert from the calculated volume of solution
	to the mass (kg) of solution, or (2) the user-specified value of density is used to make the conversion.
	Again, density is only used if the user-model concentration units are ppm.
	
	The change in method names is intended to emphasize the difference between the user-specified densities
	and the module-calculated densities. 
	
	Changed documentation of GetSaturation and related functions to GetSaturationCalculated.
		(GetSaturation still exists for backward compatibility.)
	Changed documentation of SetSaturation and related functions to SetSaturationUser.
		(SetSaturation still exists for backward compatibility.)
	
	The values specified by SetSaturationUser are used to convert user-model concentrations to module solution definitions.
	For SetConcentrations, the volume of solution is calculated to be the user-specified saturation * porosity * 
	representative volume. For GetConcentrations, two options are available to determine the solution volume, depending 
	on the value specified for SetUseSolutionDensityVolume: (1) the solution volume is calculated by the reaction module 
	and used to convert to user-model concentrations, or (2) the solution volume is again calculated by 
	user-specified saturation * porosity * representative volume, and those values are used to convert to user-model
	concentrations. In either case, the values returned by GetSaturationCalculated are the calculated solution volume divided
	by (porosity * representative volume).
		
	The change in method names is intended to emphasize the difference between the user-specified saturations and 
	and the module-calculated saturations.
	
	-----------------
	April 16, 2023
	-----------------
	PhreeqcRM: Added new methods to simplify getting and setting component and 
	aqueous species concentrations.
	
	New methods:
	GetIthConcentration(int i, std::vector<double>& c)--Gets the ith component concentration as
		of the last RunCells calculation. Total number of components is retrieved with GetComponentCount.
	GetIthSpeciesConcentration(int i, std::vector<double>& c)--Gets the ith aqueous species concentration as
		of the last RunCells calculation. Total number of aqueous species is retrieved with GetSpeciesCount.
		This method is for use with multicomponent diffusion, and SetSpeciesSaveOn must be set to true.
	SetIthConcentration(int i, std::vector<double>& c)--Sets the ith component concentration; done after
		transport calculations and before RunCells calculation. Total number of components is retrieved 
		with GetComponentCount. SetIthConcentration must be run for every component before RunCells is called.
	SetIthConcentration(int i, std::vector<double>& c)--Sets the ith aqueous species concentration; done after
		transport calculations and before RunCells calculation. Total number of aqueous species is 
		retrieved with GetSpeciesCount. This method is for use with multicomponent diffusion, 
		and SetSpeciesSaveOn must be set to true. SetIthSpeciesConcentration must be run for every aqueous
		species before RunCells is called.
		
	Fortran versions are
	RM_GetIthConcentration(id, i, c)
	RM_GetIthSpeciesConcentration(id, i, c)
	RM_SetIthConcentration(id, i, c)
	RM_SetIthSpeciesConcentration(id, i, c)

	-----------------
	April 14, 2023
	-----------------
	PhreeqcRM: Added new methods to simplify setting initial conditions.
	
	New initial conditions methods:
	InitialEquilibriumPhases2Module(equilibrium_phases);
	InitialExchanges2Module(exchanges);
	InitialGasPhases2Module(gas_phases);
	InitialKinetics2Module(kinetics);
	InitialSolutions2Module(solutions);
	InitialSolidSolutions2Module(solid_solutions);
	InitialSurfaces2Module(surfaces);
	
	These methods are an alternative to InitialPhreeqc2Module, which used a 7 x nxyz array to
	set all initial conditions in one method call. The new methods set only one reactant at a
	time, and all methods use a single array of index numbers (referring to definitions in 
	the InitialPhreeqc instance) of length nxyz (the number of user grid cells). The methods
	copy definitions from the InitialPhreeqc instance to define initial conditions in the
	model cells.
	
	Fortran implementation is as follows:
	RM_InitialEquilibriumPhases2Module(id, equilibrium_phases);
	RM_InitialExchanges2Module(id, exchanges);
	RM_InitialGasPhases2Module(id, gas_phases);
	RM_InitialKinetics2Module(id, kinetics);
	RM_InitialSolutions2Module(id, solutions);
	RM_InitialSolidSolutions2Module(id, solid_solutions);
	RM_InitialSurfaces2Module(id, surfaces);

	-----------------
	February 28, 2023
	-----------------
	PhreeqcRM: 	Revised names for PhreeqcRM test case source and output 
	files (Tests subdirectory of distribution). Added tests SimpleAdvect_cpp,  
	SimpleAdvect_c and SimpleAdvect_f90. All transport results are the same for
	Advect_cpp, Advect_c, and Advect_f90, SimpleAdvect_cpp,  
	SimpleAdvect_c and SimpleAdvect_f90; however, the SimpleAdvect cases use
	a minimal set of method calls, whereas the other cases demonstrate most
	of the features of PhreeqcRM. 	

	-----------------
	February 26, 2023
	-----------------
	PhreeqcRM: 	Added method InitializeYAML to initialize a PhreeqcRM
	instance.
	
	It is possible to use a YAML  file to initialize the PhreeqcRM instance. 
	If a GUI is used to define model input, a YAML file could be used to 
	transfer the data from the GUI to a PhreeqcRM instance. The YAML file 
	contains names of PhreeqcRM	methods and associated data, for example:
	
	RunFile:
	  workers: true
	  initial_phreeqc: true
	  utility: true
	  chemistry_name: advect.pqi
		
	InitializeYAML can be used to process the directives defined in 
	the YAML file. The method InitializeYAML is equivalent to BMI_Initialize.
	
	A C++ class named YAMLPhreeqcRM is included in the Tests subdirectory
	of the PhreeqcRM distribution, which provides the capability to generate
	a PhreeqcRM YAML file. The file WriteYAMLFile.cpp generates a YAML file
	and advection_bmi_cpp.cpp reads and processes the file to initialize
	a PhreeqcRM instance. 

	-----------------
	February 26, 2023
	-----------------
	PhreeqcRM: Added a BMI (Basic Model Interface) for C++ and Fortran. 
	The interface is a repackaging of the available methods of 
	PhreeqcRM. All PhreeqcRM methods are available in addition
	to the BMI methods.
	
	New capabilities include (1) the capability to
	retrieve units for the variables for BMI_GetValues and BMI_SetValues,
	(2) the capability to use YAML (YAML ain't Markup Language)
	to initialize a PhreeqcRM instance with the method BMI_Initialize
	(which is equivalent to the method InitializeYAML), and (3) the availability
	of pointers that always point to current variable values. 
	
	The YAML capability would be especially useful if a GUI (Graphical User Interface)
	is used to set up model initial conditions. The GUI could write a YAML file
	that contains directives for PhreeqcRM methods that need to be run and 
	the corresponding data needed to initialize a PhreeqcRM instance--for example,
	setting units; running a PHREEQC input	file to define initial and 
	boundary conditions; distribution of initial conditions to the model cells; 
	setting initial porosity, saturation, temperature, and pressure. 
	When a PhreeqcRM instance is created by the simulator, it can process 
	the YAML file with BMI_Initialize to execute the specified PhreeqcRM methods 
	to apply the data specified in the YAML file. 
	
	The following represents the way BMI methods would be used to implement
	a sequential, noniterative transport calculation:
	
	    PhreeqcRM phreeqc_rm(nxyz, nthreads);
	    phreeqc_rm.Initialize("myfile.yaml");
	    int ncomps;
	    phreeqc_rm.GetValue("ComponentCount", &ncomps);
	    int ngrid;
	    phreeqc_rm.GetValue("GridCellCount", ngrid);
	    std::vector c(ngrid*ncomps, 0.0);
	    phreeqc_rm.GetValue("Concentrations", c.data());
	    phreeqc_rm.SetValue("TimeStep", 86400);
	    for(double time = 0; time < 864000; time+=86400)
	    {
	        // Take a transport time step here and update the vector c.
			your_transport(c);
	        phreeqc_rm.SetValue("Time", time);
	        phreeqc_rm.SetValue("Concentrations", c.data());
	        phreeqc_rm.Update();
	        phreeqc_rm.GetValue("Concentrations", c.data());
	    }
		
	The set of BMI methods is as follows:
	
	std::string GetComponentName()
		Returns "PhreeqcRM".
		
	double GetCurrentTime()
		Returns current time that has been set by the user.
		
	double GetEndTime()
		Returns current time plus the time step.
		
	int GetInputItemCount()
		Returns the number of variables that it is possible to set
		with SetValue.
		
	std::vector<std::string> GetInputVarNames()
		Returns a list of the names of variables that can be set
		with SetValue.
		
	int GetOutputItemCount()
		Returns the number of variables that it is possible to retrieve
		with GetValue.
		
	std::vector<std::string> GetOutputVarNames()
		Returns a list of the names of variables that can be retrieved
		with GetValue.
		
	double GetTimeStep()
		Returns the current time step that has been set by the user.
		
	std::string GetTimeUnits()
		Returns "seconds".
		
	void GetValue(std::string name, void* dest)
		Returns a value or vector of values for the variable identified by name
		
	void GetValuePtr(std::string name, void* dest)
		Returns a pointer to current values of a variable. This method
		is available for selected variables.
		
	int GetVarItemsize(std::string name)
		Returns the number of bytes needed for one element of the variable
		identified by name.
		
	int GetVarNbytes(std::string name)
		Returns the total number of bytes needed to store the value or vector
		of values identified by name.
		
	std::string GetVarType(std::string name)
		Returns the type of the variable identified by name: "int", "double", or
		"string".
		
	std::string GetVarUnits(std::string name)	
		Returns the units associated with the variable identified by name.
		
	void Initialize(std::string config_file)
		Same as InitializeYAML discussed above.

	void SetValue(std::string name, void* src)
		Sets the value or vector of values for the variable identified by name.
		
	void Update(void)
		Calculates chemical reactions for a time step. It is equivalent to
		the method RunCells. Equilibrium will be calculated between the solution 
		and all equilibrium reactants (EQUILIBRIUM_PHASES, EXCHANGE, etc), and
		KINETICS will be integrated for the time step.
		
	BMI is implemented in Fortran with USE BMIPhreeqcRM. Methods are nemed with a
	prefix "bmif" and have an additional initial argument to identify the instance of
	BMIPhreeqcRM that is being used.

	-----------------
	PHREEQC: Fixed bug with Basic functions PR_P and PR_PHI. Values
	were incorrect after the first step when INCREMENTAL_REACTIONS
	was set to true.
	
	-----------------
	February 25, 2023
	-----------------
	ALL PROGRAMS: Added the latest version of the database Thermoddem to 
	the distributions of PHREEQC programs. The database was downloaded
	from https://thermoddem.brgm.fr/.
	
	-----------------
	March 23, 2022
	-----------------
	PHREEQC: "MacInnes" was misspelled in one of the warning messages.

	-----------------
	December 18, 2021
	-----------------
	PHREEQC: Fixed transport bug where the end cell should not have
	been processed in part of the calculation.

Version 3.7.3: December  2, 2021

	-----------------
	November 27, 2021
	-----------------
	PHREEQC: Fixed a recently introduced bug in the options 
	-print_cells and -punch_cells of the ADVECTION data block. 
	Ranges of cells using "-", such as
	
	ADVECTION
	-punch_cells 1-10 11 12-20
	
	were not read properly. Ranges of cells are now read 
	correctly.

	----------------
	November 7, 2021
	----------------
	PHREEQC: Modified the initial guess for the potential terms
	when a surface related to a phase comes into existence; that is
	when the phase begins to precipitate. 

	----------------
	October 25, 2021
	----------------
	PHREEQC: The Basic function DIFF_C returned an incorrect value at 
	temperatures other than 25 C. The value returned was missing a 
	factor TK/298.15, where TK is the current temperature in Kelvin. The 
	factor has now been added and the function returns the correct 
	value. Note that previous documentation indicated the returned 
	value was for 25 C, but the value returned is actually for the 
	current temperature of the system. 
	
	The return value for SETDIFF_C was also missing the factor TK/298.15.
	This Basic function now returns the correct value for the current 
	temperature of the system (TK). 
	
	The Basic functions are provided only for user output, so all TRANSPORT 
	calculations used the correct temperature-dependent diffusion coefficients.
	
	----------------
	October 25, 2021
	----------------
	PHREEQC: Revised a bug fix from May 28, 2021 making Fe(+3) and Fe(3) 
	equivalent names in SELECTED_OUTPUT and Basic functions TOT and TOTMOL.
	The previous fix had unintended consequences for element names like [Fe+3], 
	causing this definition to fail. The revised bug fix should eliminate the
	unintended problem.
	
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.7.1: September 21, 2021	
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	--------------
	August 25, 2021
	--------------
	PHREEQC: Added new Basic functions MCD_JTOT and MCD_JCONC that return
	multicomponent diffusion fluxes. MCD_JTOT returns the value of equation
	10 in the description of the TRANSPORT keyword in the PHREEQC 3 manual
	for an aqueous species. MCD_JCONC returns the flux calculated by the
	first term of equation 10. The functions ignore interlayer diffusion
	and only apply to multicomponent diffusion. Here are Basic examples.
	Uphill diffusion occurs when the two functions have opposite signs.

	10 jtot = MCD_JTOT("Cl-")
	20 jconc = MCD_JCONC("Cl-")

	--------------
	July 30, 2021
	--------------
	PHREEQC: Modified the numerical method for Pitzer calculations when using
	Peng-Robinson  gases. The calculation of numerical derivatives was 
	modified to account for the sequence of calculations, particularly that
	the mole fractions of gases are calculated within the molalities method. 

	-------------
	June 14, 2021
	-------------
	PhreeqcRM: Added capability to save the chemical state of the module in memory to 
	allow resetting at a later point in the calculation. The capability would be useful
	for implementing an SIA (sequential iterative approach) for iterating the transport
	rate terms between the transport code and the chemistry in PhreeqcRM. Three new
	methods have been added to save, apply, and delete a chemical state.
	
	status = phreeqcrm.StateSave(i);
	...
	status = phreeqcrm.StateApply(i);
	status = phreeqcrm.StateDelete(i);
	
	--------------
	May 28, 2021
	--------------
	PHREEQC: Fixed SELECTED_OUTPUT feature where Fe(+3) (and others) were not identified
	as legitimate redox states. Absence of "+" worked as expected. Same fix
	for Basic functions TOT and TOTMOL.

	--------------
	April 10, 2021
	--------------
	PHREEQC: Fixed -add_constant for phases and aqueous, exchange, surface species.
	
	PHREEQC: Caught NULL pointer when a SURFACE was defined with a surface not 
	defined in SURFACE_MASTER_SPECIES or SURFACE_SPECIES.
	
	PHREEQC: Fixed a catastrophic error under some conditions when a surface was used 
	with a SIT database. Also enabled EDL calculation for SIT databases; the EDL is 
	calculated, but the results have not been tested for correctness.

	                                (assuming no SELECTED_OUTPUT fields are defined).

SETDIFF_C("CO3-2", 1.18e-9)         Sets dw for a species (see SOLUTION_SPECIES), returns

	Bug fix of removal of Donnan layer calculations when kinetic 
	reactions are zero in Runge-Kutta calculations.
	
	SIs of phases are now printed with the phase mole transfers 
	found by INVERSE_MODELING. This is useful for checking that

	224, 262-275. 

	-------------
	March 2, 2021
	-------------
	PhreeqcRM: Added new methods to retrieve and set the volumes
	of the gas phases in the cells. GetGasPhaseVolume retrieves
	the volume of the gas phase in each cell. The value is set
	to -1.0 for cells that do not have a gas phase.
	
	SetGasPhaseVolume only applies to fixed-volume gas phases.
	An array of gas volumes is applied to the gas phases in the
	cells. If the volume is negative for a cell, the gas volume
	in the cell remains unchanged. If the volume is greater or
	equal to zero, the volume is applied to the cell, and the
	gas phase is forced to be a fixed-volume gas phase.

	C++:
	IRM_RESULT GetGasPhaseVolume(std::vector<double>& gas_pressure);
	IRM_RESULT setGasPhaseVolume(const std::vector<double>& gas_pressure);
	
	Size of the vector is nxyz, the number of cells in the 
	transport model.
	
	C: 
	IRM_RESULT RM_GetGasPhaseVolume(int id, double* gas_volume);
	IRM_RESULT RM_SetGasPhaseVolume(int id, double* gas_volume);
	
	Size of the array is nxyz*sizeof(double), where nxyz is the 
	number of cells in the transport model.
	
	Fortran90: 
	IRM_RESULT RM_GetGasPhaseVolume(int id, double precision gas_volume(:));
	IRM_RESULT RM_SetGasPhaseVolume(int id, double precision gas_volume(:));

	February 26, 2021
	-----------------
	
	PhreeqcRM: Added new methods to retrieve values for 
	gas components in each cell--moles, pressures, and 
	fugacity coefficients (phi). A list of gas components is 
	accumulated by call(s) to FindComponents, and retrieved 
	by the method GetGasComponents. An array containing 
	moles of components for each cell in the transport model 
	is retrieved with GetGasCompMoles; similarly for 
	GetGasCompPressures, and GetGasCompPhi. If GAS_PHASE is not 
	defined for a cell or a GAS_PHASE does not contain a component, 
	the array will contain the value -1.0 in those positions. 
	Fugacities of gas components can be calculated as the product
	of the pressure and fugcity coefficient.
	
	Moles of gas components in the chemistry cells can be set 
	with the method SetGasCompMoles. A negative value is used to 
	represent components that are absent from a cell.	

	C++:
	IRM_RESULT GetGasCompMoles(std::vector<double>& gas_moles);
	IRM_RESULT GetGasCompPressures(std::vector<double>& gas_pressure);
	IRM_RESULT GetGasCompPhi(std::vector<double>& gas_phi);
	IRM_RESULT SetGasCompMoles(const std::vector<double>& gas_moles);
	
	The argument of each method is a vector of size nxyz*ngcomps, where 
	nxyz is the number of cells in the transport model and ngcomps is
	the number of gas components returned by GetGasComponentCount. 
	
	C:
	IRM_RESULT RM_GetGasCompMoles(int id, double* gas_moles);
	IRM_RESULT RM_GetGasCompPressures(int id, double* gas_pressure);
	IRM_RESULT RM_GetGasCompPhi(int id, double* gas_phi);
	IRM_RESULT RM_SetGasCompMoles(int id, double* gas_moles);
	
	For each function, the first argument(id) is an integer, and 
	the second argument is an array of size nxyz*ngcomps*sizeof(double),
	where nxyz is the number of cells in the transport model and 
	ngcomps is the number of gas components returned by 
	RM_GetGasComponentCount. 
	
	Fortran90:
	INTEGER FUNCTION RM_GetGasCompMoles(id, gas_moles)
	INTEGER FUNCTION RM_GetGasCompPressures(id, gas_pressures)
	INTEGER FUNCTION RM_GetGasCompPhi(id, gas_phi)
	INTEGER FUNCTION RM_SetGasCompMoles(id, gas_moles)
	
	For each function, the first argument (id) is an integer, and 
	the second argument is a two dimensional array dimensioned 
	(nxyz,ngcomps), where nxyz is the number of cells in the transport 
	model and ngcomps is the number of gas components returned by 
	RM_GetGasComponentCount.

	-----------------
	PhreeqcRM: Added a new method to retrieve log10 molality (mol/kgw)
	of aqueous species.
	
	C++:
	IRM_RESULT  GetSpeciesLog10Molalities (std::vector< double > &species_log10molalities) 
	
	C:
	IRM_RESULT RM_GetSpeciesLog10Molalities(int id, double * species_log10molalities)  

	Fortran90:	
	integer function RM_GetSpeciesLog10Molalities(id, species_log10molalities) 
	
	The first argument (id) is an integer, and the second argument is a 
	two dimensional array dimensioned (nxyz,nspecies). 

	See HTML documentation of PhreeqcRM in download distributions or 
	https://water.usgs.gov/water-resources/software/PHREEQC/documentation/phreeqcrm/.
 
	-----------------
	February 20, 2021
	-----------------
	Phreeqc: Added optional 6th argument to Basic function SYS that 
	controls the sort order of the output. If the argument is absent or
	equal to 0, the sort order of species is from highest to lowest
	based on the 5th field. If the 6th argument is a nonzero integer,
	then the sort order is alphabetically based on the 3rd field. 
	
	Sort by 5th field (moles):
	SYS("element", count , name$ , type$ , moles)
	SYS("element", count , name$ , type$ , moles, 0)

	Sort by 3rd field (name$):
	SYS("element", count , name$ , type$ , moles, 1)

	-----------------
	PhreeqcRM: Fixed zero divide dumping one-cell model.
	.
	----------------
	November 24, 2020
	----------------
	PHREEQC: Added new Basic functions to control USER_PUNCH output.
	
	EOL_NOTAB$ omits the tab that is normally printed after EOL$.
	NO_NEWLINE$ omits the new line normally written after printing 
	            a USER_PUNCH block. This function can be used to completely
				eliminate a line for a cell (assuming no SELECTED_OUTPUT fields
				are defined.
				
				Example:
USER_PUNCH 2
100  IF (STEP_NO = 2 OR STEP_NO = 4) THEN GOTO 200
110    PUNCH NO_NEWLINE$
120    GOTO 300
200 REM
210   PUNCH TC, TK, EOL_NOTAB$
220   PUNCH TK, TC
300 END
				
	IPhreeqc: Added new Basic function ADD_HEADING to append a new heading to the list
	          of -headings defined in USER_PUNCH. The function returns the total
			  number of headings. This function is only helpful when using IPhreeqc.
			  
			  Example:
 USER_PUNCH 2
-heading A
10  if (GET(999) > 0) THEN GOTO 100 # define only once
20  n = ADD_HEADING("B")
30  PUT(999,1)
100 REM

	----------------
	PHREEQC: Changes to implicit Nernst Planck calculations for electro-migration.
	Concentration-oscillations in 3 cells at the column boundary are now dampened,
	which improves the stability of the calculations.

 	----------------
	August 17, 2020
	----------------
	PHREEQC: A new Basic function DEBYE_LENGTH was added to return the 
	value of the Debye length, typically notated kappa^-1. The value is 
	related to the decay of the surface potential with distance from the 
	surface. Theory says that the potential at distance d from the surface 
	is equal to psi0*exp(d/DL), where psi0 is the surface potential and DL is 
	the Debye length. The length is inversely related to ionic strength.
	Example: 
	
	10 DL = DEBYE_LENGTH

 	----------------
	August 11, 2020
	----------------
	PHREEQC: SURFACE and EXCHANGE were not updated correctly when related
	to a mineral and the moles of mineral were changed with EQUILIBRIUM_PHASES,
	EQUILIBRIUM_PHASES_MODIFY, EQUILIBRIUM_PHASES_RAW, or EQUILIBRIUM_PHASES_MIX.
	Incorrect updating also occurred when related to a kinetic reaction and 
	the moles of kinetic reaction were changed with KINETICS, KINETICS_MODIFY,
	KINETICS_RAW, or KINETICS_MIX. Now, the correct proportional relation should 
	be maintained if the moles in EQUILIBRIUM_PHASES or KINETICS are changed.
	
	An error message will result if, for example, EQUILIBRIUM_PHASES is modified
	to remove the phase that EXCHANGE is related to. 
	
 	----------------
	July 22, 2020
	----------------
	PhreeqcRM: Added new method PhreeqcRM::SetErrorOn(bool tf). This method controls
	whether error messages are written or not. A value of true will print error 
	messages; false will eliminate error messages. Print control (PhreeqcRM's 
	PHRQ_io::Set_error_on) is set for the PhreeqcRM instance and for each of the 
	IPhreeqc workers (each worker's PHRQ_io::Set_error_on). Messages include 
	PHREEQC "ERROR" messages, and any messages written with PhreeqcRM::ErrorMessage.
	
 	----------------
	June 7, 2020
	----------------
	PhreeqcRM: Modified the OpenMP version to allow retrieval of strings from
	selected output through the worker IPhreeqc instances. The PhreeqcRM
	method GetSelectedOutput retrieves only numerical values from selected
	output. Formerly, selected output was not available through the 
	IPhreeqc worker instances in the case when the output file was written
	[SetPrintChemistryOn(true)]. Now, complete selected output values (strings
	and numeric values) are always available through IPhreeqc methods on
	the workers. String values of selected output are not available in the
	MPI version. 

 	----------------
	May 24, 2020
	----------------
	
	PHREEQC:  Code was revised to remove temperature and pressure limits for 
	llnl-type databases. Previously, limits of 350 C and 1500 atm were applied to 
	all databases. These limits were removed for databases that define 
	LLNL_AQUEOUS_MODEL_PARAMETERS. It is assumed that for llnl-type databases all 
	temperature and pressure effects are defined by the 
	LLNL_AQUEOUS_MODEL_PARAMETERS data block and the temperature expressions for 
	log10(K)s of the aqueous species and phases. Implicitly, pressure for an 
	llnl-type database is either fixed or a function of temperature.
	
	In addition, the molar volume of water was set to zero for llnl-type 
	databases. The molar volume of water was calculated as a non-zero value for 
	all databases. Thus, there was a pressure dependence for log10(K) for 
	reactions involving water. For llnl-type databases, all molar volumes should 
	be zero, and all temperature and pressure dependence should be defined 
	through LLNL_AQUEOUS_MODEL_PARAMETERS and log10 Ks.  	
	
	PHREEQC: Added extra information for some ERROR messages related to -formula 
	definitions in KINETICS. Fixed some C++ 2011 compiler warnings about casts 
	and initialization of classes. 	

Version 3.6.2: January 28, 2020	
	
 	----------------
	January 28, 2020
	----------------
	PhreeqcRM: Documentation for Fortran RM_RunString had incorrect order for instances.
	The order is workers, initial_phreeqc, utilities.
	
 	----------------
	January 23, 2020
	----------------

	Updated documentation in phreeqc.chm and online 
https://water.usgs.gov/water-resources/software/PHREEQC/documentation/phreeqc3-html/phreeqc3.htm

	PHREEQC: Added silicate sorption to Hfo_w from Swedlund, P.J. and Webster, J.G., 1999, 
	Water Research 33, 3413-3422 for Amm.dat, phreeqc.dat, pitzer.dat, and wateq4f.dat.
	
	PHREEQC: Fixed memory error in TRANSPORT if number of porosities exceeded the number of cells.


Version 3.6.1: January 7, 2020
 	---------------
	January 2, 2020
	---------------

	PHREEQC: Fixed bug in TRANSPORT. The function GFW was used in a Basic program
	on elements that were not found in the database. This led to increasing the
	count of elements. The original number of elements was used to allocate space
	for transport, but the incremented number was used to free space, which caused
	a segmentation fault.

	PHREEQC:
	SURFACE 8 Constant capacitance model
	    Ha_aH		3.70E-06 1500  0.010
	    -ccm		3.196
		
	-ccm indicates that the surfaces in the surface assemblage use the 
	constant-capacitance model. The single parameter is the 
	capacitance in F/m2 (farad per square meter).	
				
	PHREEQC:
	Implicit calculation of multicomponent diffusion was extended with 1 
	stagnant layer in the column, and options were added: 

	-- When the mixing factor (defined with keyword MIX) is omitted for the 
	boundary solution and the adjacent stagnant cell, the implicit model 
	calculates a mixing factor for the boundary stagnant cell, multiplying 
	the mixing factor for the mobile cell (this is cell 1 or cell 'cells') 
	with the ratio of the kgs of water in the stagnant cell and the mobile 
	cell, see e.g. Fig. 2 of Appelo et al., 2010, GCA 74, p. 1205. Diffusion 
	into the stagnant cell can be omitted, defining a mixing factor of 0. For 
	example for a column with 'cells' = 4, stagnant cell = 6, boundary 
	solution 0: MIX 0; 6 0. 

	-- Thermal diffusion with the stagnant cells will be calculated when 
	temperatures differ by more than 0.1 °C. Multicomponent diffusion 
	coefficients decrease with the viscosity of the solution, markedly 
	affecting the results. File ex12b.phr in c:\phreeqc\exmpls compares 
	traditional and multicomponent diffusive transport of heat and solutes 
	with temperatures changing from 0 to 25 °C.

	TRANSPORT
	-implicit false/true 1 -30

	Added an option to define the minimal log10(molality) of a species for 
	inclusion in multicomponent diffusion. The definition is done with option 
	-implicit false/true 1 -30 under keyword TRANSPORT, where 1 and -30 are 
	the default max_mixf and default minimal log10(molality) (= min_dif_LM), 
	respectively. The value for min_dif_LM could be as large as -12.

	PHREEQC:
	Removed the limit that transported moles had to be > 1e-15 in 
	multicomponent diffusion.

	PHREEQC:
	Bug fix where calculation of diffusion through the Donnan layer could 
	be bypassed.

	PHREEQC:
	TRANSPORT
	-same model 2-5 8-11
	
	Added an option to use the chemical model structure of the previous 
	calculation for specific cells with option -same_model under keyword 
	TRANSPORT. For example, -same_model 2-5 8-11 will use for cells 2-5 the 
	model defined for cell 1, and for cells 8-11 the model defined for cell 
	7. For cells 0 and 1, and 6 and 7, the model is set-up with the default 
	'check_same_model' in prep.cpp.

	PHREEQC:
	Corrected memory leaks in implicit calculations of diffusive transport.

	-----------------
	October 31, 2019
	-----------------

	PhreeqcI: Fixed bug in TRANSPORT that caused lengths and dispersivities
	to be incorrect when editing through the TRANSPORT dialog.

 	-----------------
	May 31, 2019
	-----------------
	
	PHREEQC: A new option for TRANSPORT invokes an implicit method for 
	multicomponent diffusion-only systems. In multicomponent diffusion, 
	each aqueous species diffuses according to its individual diffusion 
	coefficient. The new method allows greater time steps and thus speeds 
	the overall calculation. There is one parameter for the implicit 	
	method, which is the maximum mixing factor (max_mixf) that is allowed, 
	max_mixf = D * delta_t / delta_x^2. The default value of max_mixf = 1, 
	but it can be increased often to > 4 (depending on the required 
	accuracy and the chemistry of the system), with possible speedups of 
	about an order of magnitude relative to the default method. If max_mixf 
	is too large, calculations may not converge. With implicit true, 
	electro-migration calculations are more stable and usually (possibly) 
	avoid disturbing warnings of 'negative moles'. The implicit 
	calculations have been implemented for a regular (equally spaced) 
	column, not for stagnant cells, and not for interlayer diffusion. 	
	
	TRANSPORT
	-implicit true 2.0
	
	The activity-coefficient effect for multicomponent diffusion was 
	modified, previous versions could give an erroneously large correction.
	
	The column boundary cells 0 and count_cells + 1 are now 
	print-/punched by default when the boundary conditions are not 
	'closed'.

 	-----------------
	May 7, 2019
	-----------------
	
	PHREEQC: Added Alkalinity to iso.dat. Added error message if Alkalinity is
	missing for inverse modeling.

 	-----------------
	February 4, 2019
	-----------------
	
	PHREEQC: Fixed bug in MIX_GAS_PHASE. Formula for mixing pressures was incorrect.
	
 	-----------------
	February 4, 2019
	-----------------
	PHREEQC: A series of new keyword data blocks are available to mix reactants. Input
	is parallel to the input for the keyword MIX, which is a series of user number and
	fraction pairs. Mixtures can be formed of solutions, exchangers, equilibrium_phases, 
	gas phases, kinetic reactions, solid solutions, and surfaces. 	Synonyms of keywords 
	are in parentheses.

	SOLUTION_MIX           (MIX_SOLUTION)
	EXCHANGE_MIX           (MIX_EXCHANGE)
	EQUILIBRIUM_PHASES_MIX (MIX_EQUILIBRIUM_PHASES, EQUILIBRIUM_PHASE_MIX, MIX_EQUILIBRIUM_PHASE)
	GAS_PHASE_MIX          (MIX_GAS_PHASE)
	KINETICS_MIX           (MIX_KINETICS)
	SOLID_SOLUTIONS_MIX    (MIX_SOLID_SOLUTIONS, SOLID_SOLUTIONS_MIX, MIX_SOLID_SOLUTION)
	SURFACE_MIX            (MIX_SURFACE) 
	
	These _MIX keywords do not invoke any type of speciation or reaction calculation 
	and mostly involve a summation of moles of the various reactants. Thus, MIX differs 
	from SOLUTION_MIX in that MIX produces a reaction calculation and a distribution of 
	species, whereas SOLUTION_MIX does not. The final events of a simulation occur in the 
	order of RUN_CELLS, _MIX, COPY, DUMP, and DELETE. 
	
	Here is an example of SOLUTION_MIX, which creates a mixture of previously defined 
	solutions: 
	
	SOLUTION_MIX 2-4 # new solutions 2, 3 and 4: 
	1 0.5      # solution number, fraction 
	4 1.5      # solution number, fraction 
	6 0.3      # etc.

	PHREEQC: Revised numerical method for solid solutions to respond better to
	KNOBS -step and -pe_step convergence parameters.
	
 	-----------------
	January 28, 2019
	-----------------
	
	PHREEQC: Bug fix of incorrect mass added in solid solutions with a component 
	containing an element not present initially, but added with 
	INCREMENTAL_REACTIONS.

	PHREEQC: Enabled active_fraction factors for EXCHANGE_SPECIES in Pitzer activity 
	models, and generally improved the convergence of exchange calculations with 
	active_fraction factors.
	
	Active_fraction factors are useful for modeling non-ideal ion exchange, see 
	https://hydrochemistry.eu/exmpls/a_f.html for an example of active 
	fraction model for varying exchange selectivity.

	The aquia example https://hydrochemistry.eu/exmpls/aquia.html </A></I> now runs 3 
	times faster.
	
 	-----------------
	November 6, 2018
	-----------------
	
	PHREEQC: The Basic function SURF returned the incorrect value under some conditions
	when surface species used -mole_balance definition.

 	-----------------
	November 4, 2018
	-----------------

	PHREEQC: Fixed potential integer overflow of calculated number of mixes
	for a diffusion calculation. Now gives an error message.

 	-----------------
	October 18, 2018
	-----------------

	PHREEQC: Fixed bug with diffusion calculation if porosity was changed.

 	-----------------
	August 22, 2018
	-----------------

	PHREEQC: Completed an "operator =" method for the C++ class Phreeqc. In
	C++ programming, it is now possible to set new_phreeqc = old_phreeqc, 
	where all definitions and variables of old_phreeqc are copied to the 
	new_phreeqc instance.

 	-----------------
	August 22, 2018
	-----------------

	PHREEQC: Increased the number of iterations (100000) allowed for the solver in 
	INVERSE_MODELING calculations. Should rarely need this many iterations.

 	-----------------
	July 17, 2018
	-----------------

	PHREEQC: Fixed bug where an element name like "1W" in SOLUTION or SOLUTION_SPREAD 
	was interpreted as an isotope, but caused a NULL pointer if the ISOTOPE definitions
	did not exist.
	
 	-----------------
	July 8, 2018
	-----------------

	PHREEQC: Added option -ddl to SURFACE. Sets surface type to 
	diffuse double layer, which is the default if -no_edl and -cd_music
	are not defined.
	
 	-----------------
	June 27, 2018
	-----------------

	PhreeqcRM: Added methods to provide lists of exchange species, surface species,
	reactants, and relevant minerals and gases defined in the reaction module. The lists
	are derived from the SOLUTION, EXCHANGE, SURFACE, EQUILIBRIUM_PHASES, GAS_PHASES,
	and KINETICS definitions in the "initial phreeqc" IPhreeqc object.

	-----------------
	PHREEQC:
	Made the solid solution calculation with the Pitzer-model similar to the numerical 
	derivatives used in ion-association calculations.

	Bug-fix for porosities, which could be set incorrectly when porosities were not 
	defined in TRANSPORT simulations with more cells than before.

	Modified the diffusion properties for (possible) boundary cells in stagnant 
	calculations with enhanced transport through a Donnan layer. In version 3.4.2, 
	the harmonic mean of all the diffusional properties was introduced for all the 
	stagnant cells. However, many models use cell 3 and cell [2 + stagnant cells] 
	as outer, well-mixed reservoir solutions, and diffusion is then determined by 
	the properties of the boundary cells in the column (similar to the regular column, 
	where cells 0 and [cells + 1] are well-mixed). If cells 3 and [2 + stagnant cells] 
	are without a surface with a Donnan layer, they are taken as well-mixed now. 

	Thus:
	--cell 3 without donnan layer, cell 4 with a donnan layer: diffusion is determined 
	by the properties of cell 4.

	--cell 3 without donnan layer, cell 4 without a donnan layer: diffusion is determined 
	by the harmonic mean of the properties of cells 3 & 4.

	PHREEQC's choice can be manipulated, adding a surface with a very small number of sites 
	and a tiny Donnan layer in cell 3 and/or the cells it diffuses into, and similar 
	for cell [2 + stagnant cells]. See example opa_col3.phr (http://www.hydrohemistry.eu).

	A Donnan layer on SURFACEs can now be calculated with the Pitzer database.

	Bug-fixes for option -numerical_derivatives in KNOBS, setting it true may 
	improve convergence of donnan layer calculations 
	(for example, try it in http://www.hydrochemistry.eu/exmpls/membrane.phr).
	Overall iterations (this is, all the calls to CLI in a reaction step) are 
	printed in the output file if different from the iterations in the final set. 
	It can be USER_PRINTED/PUNCHED with the variable 'iterations'.

	Streamlined the output of -debug_prep in KNOBS. Added options 
	-debug_mass_balance (total moles of elements), and -debug_mass_action 
	(species data: log_k, dz, reaction stoichiometry).

	The numbers in the matrix for CLI can be inspected in 
	my_array[row * (count_unknowns + 1) + col].

 	-----------------
	May 1, 2018
	-----------------
	PhreeqcRM: Added new methods to retrieve log10 activity coefficients
	of aqueous species.
	
	C++ method:
	IRM_RESULT  GetSpeciesLog10Gammas (std::vector< double > &species_log10gammas) 
	
	Fortran method:	
	integer function RM_GetSpeciesLog10Gammas(integer, intent(in) id,  
	   double precision, dimension(:,:), intent(out)  species_log10gammas) 

	C method:
	IRM_RESULT RM_GetSpeciesLog10Gammas(int id, double * species_log10gammas)

	DATABASE: Updated to latest version of core10.dat by Marc Neveu, which fixed
	a couple errors in the database.

	March 9, 2018
	-----------------
	Bug fix in TRANSPORT: solutions were not updated when mixing was not 
	defined for the highest number of the stagnant cells.

	Bug fix in TRANSPORT: a SURFACE without any charged-surface component 
	could give a segmentation fault.

	-----------------
	March 7, 2018
	-----------------
	Input files with experimental data obtained at high T, P, and 
	salinity are installed by the phreeqc-installer in c:\phreeqc\high_P_T.

	Multicomponent diffusion in stagnant zones now uses the harmonic mean of 
	the cell properties, where earlier versions took the average. If the 
	properties are equal, the results will be identical; if the properties 
	vary, the cells with slow diffusion are now given stronger weight.
	In Example 21 (radial diffusion of tracers through Opalinus Clay), the 
	clay has other properties than the filters that hold the sample. For 
	matching the experimental results, the fit parameters were adapted 
	(CEC, EDL enrichment of 22Na+ and Cs+, tortuosity of 36Cl-, and the 
	geometrical factor for interlayer diffusion). For neutral species like 
	HTO, the calculations are not affected.

	The multicomponent diffusion function was rewritten to include diffusion 
	through the EDL's of differently charged surfaces. (Earlier versions 
	calculated diffusion through one EDL only, of the first surface in 
	alphabetical order.)

	Bug fix with pitzer database, when running with McInnes scaling, but without 
	Cl in the solution.

	-----------------
	February 20, 2018
	-----------------
	Phreeqc: Fixed a segmentation fault when Cl was absent from a 
	Pitzer calculation, but MacInnes scaling was used; further,
	the calculation was a redox calculation.

	Print and punch of cells in transport calculations with 
	stagnant zones follows the order of the cell numbers.
	
	Enabled multicomponent diffusion among boundary and stagnant 
	cells, and of cells within a stagnant layer.
	For example, with 2 cells in the column, 1 stagnant layer:
	MIX 0; 4 0.5; MIX 4; 5 0.1
	
	Bug fix for electro-migration through a column (membrane) 
	that contains pure water.
	
	-----------------
	February 15, 2018
	-----------------
	
	PHREEQC: In agreement with IAPWS data 0-250 C, changed 
	the temperature damping coefficient of Dw for H+ to 1000 in 
	SOLUTION_SPECIES for Amm.dat, phreeqc3.dat, and pitzer.dat. 
	-dw 9.31e-9 1000 0.46 1e-10
	
	Added Hfo CO3-2 species to Pitzer.dat.
	
	Added new database for organic-ligand binding approximating WHAM by Tipping
	and Hurley.
	

Version 3.4.0: November 9, 2017 (svn 12927)

	The effect of an electrical field on multicomponent diffusion (electro-migration) is
	calculated with the Nernst-Planck equation if one of the 2 column end-cell solutions has
	a potential different from 0 (SOLUTION 0, SOLUTION cells + 1). For examples of electro-
	migration, see http://www.hydrochemistry.eu/exmpls/electro_dif.html. 
	
	A number of new features have been implemented for electro-migration.

	(1) The electric potential can be defined in keyword SOLUTION:
	
	SOLUTION 1
		-potential 3 # Volt
	

	(2) The electric current in a column experiment can be defined in keyword TRANSPORT:
	
	TRANSPORT
		-current 1e-3 # Ampere

	(3) When using -multi_d and -interlayer_d in TRANSPORT, the
	porosity for calculating interlayer diffusion is added to the porosity 
	defined with -porosities or -multi_d. For example:
	
	-porosities 0.3 0.29 0.28 ...
		-multi_d true 1e-9 0.3 0.05 1.0 false
		-interlayer_d true 0.07 0.01 250

	The total porosities will be 0.37, 0.36, 0.35, ... in cells 1, 2, 3, ...
	In previous versions, the interlayer porosity was subtracted from the porosity 
	defined with -multi_d.

	(4) If the properties in a regular column (surface areas, lengths, double layers,
	tortuosities, diffusion coefficients) are different for the two cells, the harmonic mean
	is used for calculating the mass transfer (Appelo et al., 2010, Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta
	74, 1201-1219).
	
	(5) The following Basic functions have been added:
	
	CURRENT_A      # the current through the column, amps.
	POT_V          # potential in a cell, volts.
	T_SC("Cl-")    # The transport- or transference-number of the ion, equal to the 
	               # fraction of the specific conductance contributed by the species(-).
	VISCOS         # At present, returns the viscosity of a pure water solution, same as
	               # VISCOS_0, milliPascal second.
	VISCOS_0       # Returns the viscosity of a pure water solution at current conditions
	               # milliPascal second.

	
	(6) A temperature damping factor and two parameters for ionic strength dependence were added for
	the calculation of the diffusion coefficient of a solute species:

	SOLUTION_SPECIES
	H+ = H+
		-dw	9.31e-9  763  0.46  1e-10
		
	where the first number is the diffusion coefficient at 25 C, and the second number is a damping
	factor for the temperature correction, as proposed by Smolyakov, according to Anderko and Lencka,
	1997, Ind. Chem. Eng. Res. 36, 1932-1943:
	
	Dw(TK) = 9.31e-9 * exp(763 / TK - 763 / 298.15) * TK * 0.89 / (298.15 * viscos).
	
	The ionic strength correction is as follows:
	Dw(I) = Dw(TK) * exp(-0.46 * DH_A * |z_H+| * I^0.5 / (1 + DH_B * I^0.5 * 1e-10 / (1 + I^0.75)))

	PHREEQC: Added a new option for a density calculation to SOLUTION
	and SOLUTION_SPREAD. The speciation calculation for a solution is
	iterated until the density used in the conversion of units is the
	same as the density calculated for the solution. It affects solutions 
	with concentrations defined as per liter (mg/L, for example).
	
	Here are three examples for specifying the calculation, where \t
	indicates a tab.
	
	SOLUTION
	-density 1.1 calculate
	
	SOLUTION_SPREAD
	-density 1.2 calculate
	
	SOLUTION_SPREAD

Version 3.3.11: March 10, 2017 (svn 12535)
	---------
	svn 12480
	---------	
	PHREEQC: Added the ColdChem.dat database developed by Toner and
	Catling, Journal of Chemical & Engineering Data, 2017, DOI: 10.1021/
	acs.jced.6b00812. It is a comprehensive Pitzer model in the Na-K-Ca-Mg-
	Cl system valid for low temperature, from 298.15 to < 200 K.
	PHREEQC was modified to allow definition of the temperature dependence
	of A(phi) in the Pitzer formulation through a new option, -APHI, in 
	the PITZER keyword. The coefficients of the APHI expression are the
	same as the temperature dependence of other Pitzer parameters.
	A new Basic function, APHI, has been added to give the value of 
	the parameter in the current calculation.

	---------
	svn 12204
	---------
	PHREEQC: Updated Basic function SYS("equi"...). The function now gives
	the correct amounts of equilibrium phases at the end of a reaction.

	---------
	svn 11942
	---------

	The files are difficult to find, and, under some conditions, PhreeqcI would fail. Now,
	it is not allowed to write into directories for which the user does not have write
	permission.
	
	---------
	svn 11201
	---------
	PHREEQC: Added new Basic function PHASE_VM("Calcite"). The function returns the molar volume

	Use the Basic function GAS_VM for gas components.
	
	---------
	svn 11152
	---------
	PHREEQC: Added two new Basic functions related to KINETICS.
	
	n$ = KINETICS_FORMULA$("Albite", count, elt$, coef)
	
	This function searches for a kinetic reaction definition (Albite, in the example). If found, n$
	is set equal to the first argument (Albite), otherwise an empty string is returned. The
	function returns these values: count is the number of items in the arrays elt$ and coef; elt$
	is a list of element names in the formula for the kinetic reaction; and coef is a numeric
	array containing the number of atoms of each element in the kinetic-reaction formula, in the
	order defined by elt$, which is alphabetical by element.
	
	m = SYS("kin", count , name$ , type$ , moles)
	
	This function identifies all of the kinetic reactants in the current KINETICS definition
	and returns the sum of moles of all kinetic reactants. Count is number of kinetic
	reactants. Name$ contains the kinetic reactant names. Type$ is "kin". Moles contains the
	moles of each kinetic reactant. The chemical formula used in the kinetic reaction can be
	determined by using a reaction name from Name$ as the first argument of the
	KINETICS_FORMULA$ Basic function.

	EDL_SPECIES(surf$, count, name$, moles, area, thickness)
	
	Returns the total number of moles of species in the diffuse layer. The arguments to the function are
	as follows: surf$ is the name of a surface, such as "Hfo", excluding the site type (such as "_s");
	count is the number of species in the diffuse layer; name$ is an array of size count that contains
	the names of aqueous species in the diffuse layer of surface surf$; moles is an array of size count
	that contains the number of moles of each aqueous species in the diffuse layer of surface surf$;
	area is the area of the surface in m^2; thickness is the thickness of the diffuse layer in m. The
	function applies when -donnan or -diffuse_layer is defined in SURFACE calculations.
	
	Corrected description of "EQUI" option of the SYS function.

Version 3.3.5 (10806): February 3, 2016

	---------
	svn 10804
	---------
	PHREEQC: Created an option to enter cell porosities in keyword TRANSPORT, which was
	motivated by the need to define porosities for a variable-porosity multicomponent diffusion 
	problem. Previously the Basic function CHANGE_POR had to be used to allow variable porosity.

		-porosities 0.3 0.29 0.28  # porosities of cells 1, 2, 3-n, used for calculating
					   # tortuosity in multicomponent diffusion calculations. The
					   # numbers entered here take precedence over the value given
					   # with -multi_D. If one stagnant layer is defined together with
					   # an exchange-factor > 0 ('-stagnant 1 4e-6 0.3 0.1'), the
					   # mobile (here = 0.3) and immobile (here = 0.1) porosities
					   # defined with -stagnant are used.

	IPhreeqc: Added optional argument sl to GetSelectedOutputValue in Fortran. The revised method
	is as follows, where sl is a new optional argument. 
	
	CHARACTER(LEN=40) :: sv
	status = GetSelectedOutputValue(id, i, j, vt, dv, sv, sl)
	
	In the example, if the character string generated in IPhreeqc and stored in sv is 40 characters or
	less, the value of sl will be 0. If the character string generated in IPhreeqc was greater than
	40 characters, the truncated string is stored in sv, but the value of sl will contain the length
	of the string before truncation.

	PhreeqcRM: Revised code to minimize memory footprint for MPI. Revised the logic
	so that some variables, like porosity and saturation, have only the values

	    New Basic function EDL_SPECIES returns the moles of
	    species in the electrical double layer. Applies when -DONNAN or 
	    -DIFFUSE_LAYER are defined in SURFACE calculations.


	EDL_SPECIES(surf$, count, name$, moles, area, thickness)
	
	The function returns the total number of moles of species in the 
	diffuse layer. The arguments to the function are as follows:
	
	surf$ is the name of a surface, such as "Hfo", excluding
		the site type (such as "_s").
	count is the number of species in the diffuse layer.
	name$ is an array of size count that contains the
		names of aqueous species in the diffuse layer
		of surface surf$.
	moles is an array of size count that contains the number
		of moles of each aqueous species in the diffuse layer
		of surface surf$.
	area  is the area of the surface in m^2.
	thickness is the thickness of the diffuse layer in m.
	
	The volume of the diffuse layer is area * thickness, and
	the concentrations of the species in the diffuse layer are
	the number of moles divided by the volume.
	    
	    Example:
10 t = EDL_SPECIES("Hfo", count, name$, moles, area, thickness)
20 PRINT "Surface: Hfo"
30 PRINT "Area:       ", area
40 PRINT "Thickness:  ", thickness

Version 3.2.0: June 10, 2015 

	    --------
	    svn 9809

	    See README.IPhreeqc.TXT for additional information about the IPhreeqc Module.

	    The IPhreeqc module has been updated to use CMake (build process manager)
	    for Visual Studio builds. CMake can be downloaded from http://www.cmake.org.
	 
	    Fortran, you will need to include the source file IPhreeqc_interface.F90
	    in your project files. This file defines the IPhreeqc Fortran module.
	 
	    For example:

	    USE IPhreeqc
	    INTEGER(KIND=4) id
	    id = CreateIPhreeqc()
	    
	    This replaces the need to use the include files IPhreeqc.f.inc/IPhreeqc.f90.inc.

	    You will need to link to the IPhreeqc(d).lib/libiphreeqc.a that is created
	    during the build process.

	    cell lengths.

	    --------
	    svn 8469
	    --------
	    
	    Logic for connecting points in USER_GRAPH was revised.

	    --------
	    svn 8453
	    --------
	    
	    Error where punch file was deleted twice if there was a Basic error.
	    No longer an error if you try to modify a non-existing entity (SOLUTION,
	    EXCHANGE, etc), only a warning.
	    
	    --------
	    svn 8378
	    --------
	    
	    Removed yellow from colors for graphing; it was sometimes hard to see.
	    Changed Li molar volume in pitzer.dat, Amm.dat, and phreeqc.dat.

	    -------------
	    svn 8371-8375
	    -------------
	    
	    Multiple bug fixes pointed out by Marco De-Vroed. Set basic_interpreter 
	    to NULL after deleting. Revised handling of initial data for initial-solution
	    calculations. Revised logic for switching to numerical derivatives for 
	    high-pressure calculations, the variable switch_numerical was removed.
	    
	    --------
	    svn 8356
	    --------
	    
	    Fixed bug with solution volume in initial solutions
	    containing Alkalinity.

	    svn 8301
	    --------

	    Density was not stored with the solution after a calculation.
	    
	    --------
	    svn 8293
	    --------
	    
	    Solution volume was not initialized in zero(), and pressure was not set correctly
	    when mixing solutions.
	    

Version 3.1.1: December 6, 2013

	    --------
	    svn 8203
	    --------
	    
	    Updated more molar volumes in phreeqc.dat, Amm.dat, and
	    pitzer.dat. Mn+2, Al+3, PO4-3, F-, Li+, Br-, Zn+2, Cd+2, 
	    Cu+2, NH4+, HPO4-2, H2PO4-, and H3PO4, and other related
	    ion pairs or complexes. Also estimated more ion size parameters
	    for pairs and complexes. Molar volume approach is published
	    in Appelo, Parkhurst, and Post, 2013, Geochimica et Cosmochimica 
	    Acta, v. 125, p. 49-67.
	
	    --------
	    svn 7997
	    --------
	    
	    Modified chart handling for PhreeqcI to allow charts from
	multiple runs to remain open for comparison. Charts will
	remain visible until closed.

	    --------
	    svn 7992
	    --------
	    
	    Identifier -high_precision was added to the PRINT data
	block to allow higher precision for the PRINT Basic
	command, which is generally used in USER_PRINT
	definitions.

	    --------
	    svn 7987
	    --------
	    
	    Now can have multiple SELECTED_OUTPUT n and USER_PUNCH n.
	SELECTED_OUTPUT 1 has the same functionality as previous
	versions of SELECTED_OUTPUT, with a set of default print
	definitions. SELECTED_OUTPUT n, where n is not equal to 1,
	has no fields initially defined; it is equivalent to an
	automatic -reset false.
	    
	    A file may be defined for each SELECTED_OUTPUT n that will
	receive the output from the data block. Using i to
	represent a specific integer, USER_PUNCH i will write to
	the file defined for SELECTED_OUTPUT i. If USER_PUNCH i is
	defined, but SELECTED_OUTPUT i is not, then no data will
	be written from USER_PUNCH i.
	    
	    Printing to the selected-output files is controlled 
	    by three identifiers. PRINT; -selected_output true/false
	    will enable/disable printing of all selected-output 
	    files. For an individual SELECTED_OUTPUT i definition,
	    -active true/false will enable/disable both 
	    SELECTED_OUTPUT i and USER_PUNCH i. Again for 
	    SELECTED_OUTPUT i, -user_punch true/false will enable/
	    disable the USER_PUNCH i data (rarely used).
	    
	    If SELECTED_OUTPUT i has been defined, a new data block
	    of SELECTED_OUTPUT i will retain the previous definition
	    if only -active and (or) -user_punch are defined. Defining
	    any other identifier will cause the old definition
	    to be removed and its file closed; the data for 
	    SELECTED_OUTPUT i will be defined entirely by the new 
	    data block. 

	    --------
	    svn 7962
	    --------
	    
	    Database modifications:
	    
	    pitzer.dat: Parameters have been reordered to alphabetical order.

	    phreeqc.dat and Amm.dat: Vm refit for aqueous species Na+, CO3-2, SO4-2, NO3-, 
	    HCO3-, NaCO3-, NaHCO3, NaSO4, KSO4. Analytical expression adjusted for gypsum, 
	    anhydrite, and sylvite (delta H).        
	    
	    --------
	    svn 7916
	    --------
	    
	    Addition of a temperature-dependent pressure correction for the Debye-Hueckel term
	for the Pitzer formulation. An empirical, temperature-dependent pressure correction
	has been introduced in the Debye-Hueckel part of Pitzer's equation for gamma
	(activity coefficient), which lets the factor B vary from 1.2 to 1. Pitzer defined
	this number to be 1.2 for all pressures and temperatures.
	    
	    For monovalent species the correction is:
	     pap = (7e-5 + 1.93e-9 * (TK - 250)^ 2.0) * patm_x
	For divalent species the correction is:
	     pap = (9.65e-10 * (TK - 263)^ 2.773) * (patm_x^0.623)
	In both cases, pap is limited to less than 0.2.
	
	The factor B in the Debye-Hueckel factor is
	     B = 1.2 - pap
	     
	The Debye-Hueckel factor is
	     F = = -A0 * (DI / (1.0 + B * DI) + 2.0 * log(1.0 + B * DI) / B)
	where DI is the square root of the ionic strength.

	    --------
	    svn 7972
	    --------
	    
	    A revised version of the manual is now  distributed as a
	compiled HTML file (phreeqc3.chm). It has corrections and
	new features highlighted in forest green.        
	    
	    --------
	    svn 7920
	    --------
	    
	    GAS_PHASE processing was incorrect for fixe-volume gas with
	    multiple components. The wrong number of moles of gas 
	    some gas components was calculated.
	
	    --------
	    svn 7896
	    --------
	    
	    The manual wording was wrong or confusing in some places
	regarding the difference between fugacity (F) and
	(partial) pressure (P) of a gas. For ideal gases, P = F.
	However for Peng-Robinson gases F = P * phi / 1 atm
	(unitless).
	    
	    In EQUILIBRIUM_PHASES, the target saturation index for a
	gas is log10(P). In SELECTED_OUTPUT -saturation_index, for
	gases, the value printed will be the fugacity. For Basic
	functions SI and SR, the values are based on the fugacity.
	P and phi can be obtained with the Basic functions 
	PR_P and PR_PHI.
	
	For the Saturation Index block of the output file,
	the SI for a gas is its fugacity. However, for
	Peng-Robinson gases, P and phi are appended to the
	output line.
	    
	    --------
	    svn 7884
	    --------
	    IPHREEQC: added a Basic function, CALLBACK, which
	    allows data be passed to and from the calling
	    program. The new IPhreeqc method is 
	    
	    for C,
	    iresult = SetBasicCallback(ID, function name, cookie)
	    
	    and for Fortran,
	    iresult = SetBasicFortranCallback(ID, function name)
	    
	    The two methods are necessary because arguments
	    are handled differenctly between C and Fortran.
	    The void pointer cookie in the C callback can be 
	    used to allow the user-defined callback function 
	    to find necessary data.
	    
	    The user-defined function for C must be of the form
	    double my_callback(double, double, const char *, void *)
	    
	    For Fortran the function must be of the form
	    double precision my_callback(double precision,
	    double precision, character(*))
	    
	    As an example, to get the current time for 
	    a calculation, the callback could be used as follows:
	    
	    Basic:
	    10 date = CALLBACK(dummy, dummy, "Year")
	    
	    Fortran after registering my_callback by using
	    SetBasicFortranCallback
	    
	    double precision function my_callback(x1, x2, string)
	    USE date_module, only: year
	    double precision x1, x2, my_callback
	    character(*) string
	    if (string .eq. "Year") then
	    	return dble(year)
	    endif
	    end
	    
	    A usage of the callback feature has been added to the
	IPhreeqc example advect for Fortran, C, and C++.
	Additional documentation is in the .chm documentation
	files for IPhreeqc.

	    --------
	    svn 7867
	    --------
	    
	    SOLUTION_MODIFY and SOLUTION_RAW were missing the 
	    -pressure identifier. It has now been added.
 
	    --------
	    svn 7857
	    --------
	     
	    Trapped error when solid-solution components were
	    not defined correctly.
 
	    --------
	    svn 7855
	    --------
	    
	    Error in pressure dependence when Pitzer or SIT 
	    aqueous model was used. The pressure dependence
	    was not calculated if the pressure was changed, 
	    but the temperature was not. 
	    
	    --------
	    svn 7829
	    --------
	    
	    Added Basic function EQUIV_FRAC that returns the
	    equivalent fraction of a surface or exchange
	    species. The three arguments are
	    (1) Species name (input),
	    (2) Equivalents of exchange or surface sites
	        per mole of the species (output),
	    (3) The name of the surface or exchange site
	        (output).
	    For example,
	    
	    10 f = EQUIV_FRAC("AlX3", eq, x$)
	    
	    f = equivalent fraction of AlX3 relative to
	        total equivalents of X sites.
	    eq = 3.0
	    x$ = "X"
	    
	    If the species name is not found to be a surface
	    or exchange species, the return value is 0,
	    the second argument is set to 0, and the third
	    argument is set to an empty string.
	    
	    Also added synonyms for Basic functions 
	    PHASE_FORMULA and SPECIES_FORMULA with trailing
	    $ signs--PHASE_FORMULA$ and SPECIES_FORMULA$. 
	    To be consistent with Basic, the functions should 
	    have $ signs because they return strings.
	    
	    
	    --------
	    svn 7828
	    --------
	    
	    Added Basic function SPECIES_FORMULA that returns the
	    stoichiometry of an aqueous, exchange, or surface 
	    species. The function returns a string: "aq" for 
	    aqueous, "ex" for exchange, "surf" for surface, 
	    and "none" if there is no species of that name.
	    The four arguments are
	    (1) the name of the species (input),
	    (2) the number of elements, including charge (output),
	    (3) an string array of element names (output),
	    (4) a number array of coefficients corresponding to the elements (output).
	    The following example:
	    
10   name$ = "AlX3"        
20   ty$ = SPECIES_FORMULA(name$, count_s, elt$, coef)
20   print pad(name$, 15), ty$
30   for j = 1 to count_s
40     print pad(blank$, 5), pad(elt$(j),5), str_f$(coef(j), 5, 0)
50   next j       
	
	Produces the following output:
	
AlX3            ex 
	  Al        1 
	  X         3 
	  charge     0 	
	
	    --------
	    svn 7781
	    --------
	    
	    Basic function SYS("phases",...) returned 0.0, rather
	than the maximum saturation index if the maximum
	saturation index was less than zero. Now returns the
	maximum saturation index even if it is less than zero.
	    
	    Added new Basic function STR_E$(x, w, d) that produces
	a string with exponential format from a number with a
	given width (w) and number of decimal places (d). w is
	the minimum width of the string. The string is padded
	with spaces to the left to produce a string of the
	specified width (w); however, the string will be wider
	than w characters, if the number does not fit in the
	specified width. If x = 123456.789, then STR_E$(x,15,5)
	produces the following on a Windows computer:
	
	   1.23457e+005
	
	    --------
	    svn 7766
	    --------
	    
	    Added new Basic function STR_F$(x, w, d) that produces
	a string from a number with a given width (w) and
	number of decimal places (d). w is the minimum width of
	the string. The string is padded with spaces to the
	left to produce a string of the specified width (w);
	however, the string will be wider than w characters, if
	the number does not fit in the specified width. If x =
	123456.789, then STR_F$(x,15,5) produces the following
	on a Windows computer:
	
	   123456.78900
	
	    --------
	    svn 7763
	    --------
	    
	    Fixed bug with isotopes. Moles and molalities were
	incorrect if the mass of water in the SOLUTION was not
	1.0.


Version 3.0.6: June 4, 2013
	    --------
	    svn 7757
	    --------
	    
	    Fixed bug introduced in version 3.0.5 if two DELETE
	keywords were used in a run. Fixed a bug with fixed-
	pressure gas, where the volume was 1.0 even when no
	moles of gas were present in the gas phase. Minor
	optimizations for initialization of Peng-Robinson gas
	data.
	    
Version 3.0.5: May 31, 2013
	    --------
	    svn 7748
	    --------
	    
	    Optimizations for equilibrium phases, using pointers
	instead of lookup function. Other optimizations for
	SURFACE calculations to limit uses of std::map find,
	eliminate strcmps, and skip inverse setup when not
	needed. Minor fix to Peng Robinson. Fixed bug with
	SOLUTION_MODIFY when a concentration was set to zero.
	Removed lower limit on ionic strength.

Version 3.0.4: May 14, 2013
	    --------
	    svn 7703
	    --------
	    Fixed bug in PhreeqcI that caused no warnings to be 
	    included in the output file.

	    --------
	    svn 7677
	    --------
	    Gas-phase volume was not correct in SELECTED_OUTPUT
	    -gas printout for Peng-Robinson calculations.
	
	    --------
	    svn 7677
	    --------
	    Added KIN_TIME Basic function, which gives the
	    time interval in seconds of the last kinetic 
	    integration. KIN_DELTA("xxx")/KIN_TIME will give
	    the average rate over the time interval for 
	    reaction xxx.
	    
	    For example,
	    
	    KINETICS
	    Calcite
	    	-m 1
	    -step  864 8640
	    
	    KIN_TIME will return 864 after the first
	    step and 8640 after the second. The result of
	    KIN_TIME will be the same whether INCREMENTAL_
	    REACTIONS is true or false (although TOTAL_
	    TIME will differ).
	    

	   
Version 3.0.3: April 30, 2013

	Fixed errors in GAS_PHASE, -fixed_pressure used the
	sum of the input pressures instead of the defined
	total pressure in some cases, set upper limits in PR
	calculations; revised Basic function LK_SPECIES;
	logic for printing status line revised; fixed bug in
	SOLUTION_SPREAD, mass of water was not read properly;
	fixed problem with spaces in output file name;
	revised logic for checking if opening files was
	successful, old C-style check was incorrect; revised
	molar volume definitions and selected parameters in
	databases phreeqc.dat, Amm.dat, and pitzer.dat

Version 3.0.2: April 4, 2013

	Fixed an initialization error for activity of water
	that caused slow convergence. Dump wrote a file that
	caused read errors when some names exceeded 21
	characters. Gas_phase_modify did not work correctly.

Version 3.0.1: March 21, 2013

	Fixed bug in printing of solid solutions that caused
	a crash. The pressure dependence of log K in the
	printout of the equilibrium phases assemblage in the
	saturation index list was incorrect.

Version 3.0.0: February 1, 2013

	PHREEQC Version 3 is finally released. Major new
	features include pressure dependence for geochemical
	reactions, the nonideal gas formulation of Peng and
	Robinson, and charting. All features of PHREEQC
	Version 3 are documented in U.S. Geological Survey
	Techniques and Methods 6-A43, "Description of input
	and examples for PHREEQC Version 3--A computer
	program for speciation, batch-reaction, one-
	dimensional transport, and inverse geochemical
	calculations", available at
	http://pubs.usgs.gov/tm/06/a43/. Features not
	previously documented include Pitzer and SIT aqueous
	models, CD-MUSIC surface complexation, isotopic
	capabilities, and new keyword data blocks to
	manipulate reactants, such as RUN_CELLS, DELETE,
	COPY, _MODIFY, _RAW, and DUMP.

------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.18.2: April  9, 2011
------------------------------------------------------------ 
	    --------
	    svn 5471
	    --------
	    Added PHASE_FORMULA and LIST_S_S Basic functions.
	    
	    PHASE_FORMULA returns a string value with the 
	    chemical formula for the phase as defined in 
	    PHASES data. If 4 arguments are provide, a list 
	    of the elements and stoichiometric coefficients for 
	    elements are returned.
	    
	    USER_PRINT
	    10 min$ = "Calcite"
	    20 form$ = PHASE_FORMULA(min$)
	30 print min$, form$
	40 form$ = PHASE_FORMULA(min$, count, elts$, coefs)
	50 for i = 1 to count
	60 print "   ", PAD(elts$[i], 20), coefs[i]
	70 next i 
	
	This example produces the following output:
	
Calcite CaCO3 
	C                               1 
	Ca                              1 
	O                               3 

	    LIST_S_S returns the sum of moles of all components
	    in a specified solid solution. Lists of the components
	    and the number of moles of each component are also
	    returned. 

   
	SOLID_SOLUTIONS 1
	Calcite_s_s
	       -comp Calcite 0.01
	       -comp Smithsonite 0.001
	       -comp Strontianite 0.02
	USER_PRINT
	    10 name$ = "Calcite_s_s"
	20 total = LIST_S_S(name$, count, comp$, moles)
	30 print PAD(name$, 20), total
	40 for i = 1 to count
	50 print "   ", PAD(comp$[i], 20), moles[i], moles[i]/total
	60 next i

	    This example produces the following output:
	    
Calcite_s_s           3.0876e-002 
	Calcite               9.9316e-003  3.2166e-001

	    --------
	    svn 5455
	    --------
	    REACTION_MODIFY keyword was added to the modules. Previously,
	    REACTION_MODIFY was not recognized as a keyword.
	    
	    --------
	    svn 5453
	    --------     
	    Fixed bug with in READ_SOLUTION_RAW. A read error occurred
	    when -isotopes was encountered.
	    
	    --------
	    svn 5448
	    -------- 
	    Reading of default user number, but specified description
	    was in error under some conditions.
 
	    --------
	    svn 5431
	    --------  
	    RUN_CELLS was rewritten to perform multiple calculations
	    if multiple steps are defined in REACTION, REACTION_TEMPERATURE,
	    or KINETICS. It now operates in the same way that a 
	    series of USE and SAVES would operate. Previously, only
	    one step of a series of reaction steps was taken. If a 
	    time step is provided in RUN_CELLS for kinetic reactions and
	    nmax is the maximum number of steps defined for REACTION,
	    REACTION_TEMPERATURE, and KINETICS, the time step is divided 
	    into nmax equal increments. It is equivalent to the following
	    definition in kinetics: -step time_step in nmax steps.
	    
	    --------
	    svn 5324
	    --------   
	    Modified solution method for solid solutions so that
	    mole transfers were limited to the total amount
	    available in the system.
	    
------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.18.0: April  9, 2011
------------------------------------------------------------  

	    --------
	    svn 5281
	    -------- 
	    If SOLUTION_MODIFY is used to change a total for an element,
	    the activities for the master species of the element are
	    automatically updated by the ratio of the new total to the 
	    old total, unless activities are specifically set for the
	    element with -activities. All valence states of redox elements
	    are adjusted.

	    --------
	    svn 5270
	    --------
	Added logic to update estimates of log activity when
	modifying totals in SOLUTION_MODIFY. The initial 
	guesses for activities are adjusted proportionally
	to the change in total moles of elements (as defined
	by SOLUTION_MODIFY; -totals). 

	This automatic adjustment is suggested rather than
	explicit definition of the initial guesses through
	SOLUTION_MODIFY; -activities. However, the -activities
	identifier may be used and will supersede the automatic
	adjustment.  

	The adjustment of the initial guesses for activities
	should reduce the number of iterations needed to solve 
	a given set of equations and, consequently, should
	lessen the total CPU time for a simulation.
	
	    --------
	    svn 4897
	    --------
	    Added capability to include files within the input
	    file. Files included in include files are also 
	    included. Files are included verbatim and need not
	    contain complete keyword datablocks; however, the
	    combination of included files must result in a
	    legal PHREEQC input file. Files are included as
	    simulations are proceeding, so it is possible to
	    write a file at one point of a run that is included
	    later in the same run. Included files can contain
	    INCLUDE$ directives.
	    
	    SOLUTION
	    INCLUDE$ file_name
	    END
	    
	    where "file_name" contains:
	    EQUILIBRIUM_PHASES
	    	Calcite 0 10
	    
	    is the same as a single file with 
	    SOLUTION
	    EQUILIBRIUM_PHASES
	    	Calcite 0 10
	    END
	    
	    --------
	    svn 4856
	    --------
	    Revised logic of searching pitzer parameters so that
	    order of ions in a parameter definition does not 
	    matter. 
	    
	    --------
	    svn 4823
	    --------
	    Added -cells to DUMP and DELETE; cell option to COPY.
	    Example:
	    
	    COPY cell 1 4
	    COPY cell 1 5-10
	    DUMP 
	     	-cell 1 2-3  10
	    DELETE
	    	-cell 1-3 4 8-10
	    
	    COPY cell n range
	    
	    The cell option of the COPY keyword causes all reactants
	    defined with identifying number n to be copied to a single 
	    range of numbers. The range of numbers can be a single 
	    number or a range of numbers given by an integer, a 
	    hyphen, and an integer, with no intervening spaces.
	    
	    DUMP
	    	-cell list
	    
	    The  -cell option writes _RAW formatted output to a 
	    specified file(see below for more details) for each 
	    reactant that is defined in the list.
	    
	    DUMP
	    	-cell list
	    The -cell deletes from memory all reactants that are 
	    defined with identifying numbers in the list.
	    
	    The list of numbers for DUMP and DELETE are
	    more flexible than for COPY. A list of ranges can be 
	    given for DUMP and DELETE, where each element of 
	    the list can be a single number or a range of numbers
	    defined by an integer, a hyphen, and an ingeger, with 
	    no intervening spaces. 
	    
	    --------
	svn 4816
	--------
	Added compile capability to use #include file_name
	in input and database files. PHREEQCPP process the 
	files at the start of the run, possibly following
	multiple layers of include files, to produce a stream 
	that is then used as input. Compile define is
	MERGE_INCLUDE_FILES; PHREEQC_CLASS also must be defined.
	
	Input file:
	SOLUTION 1 
	#INCLUDE t2		  	 
	#include t4
	END 
	
	File t2:
	REACTION
		NaCl
		1 mmol
	#include t3
	
	File t3:
	REACTION_TEMPERATURE
	10 20 30
	
	File t4:
	SAVE solution 1
	
	When compiled with the include file #defines, the above 
	set of files produces the following input for PHREEQC:
	
	SOLUTION 1 
	REACTION
		NaCl
		1 mmol
	REACTION_TEMPERATURE
	10 20 30	
	SAVE solution 1	
	END 

	--------
	svn 4800
	--------
	
	Added capability to dump REACTIONs, REACTION_TEMPERATUREs,
	and MIXes.
	
	DUMP
		-mix  1 4 6
		-reaction 1-5
		-reaction_temperature 1 3-9
		
	List of numbers may be formatted as described for DUMP.
	Data are written in a format suitable for an input file
	to PHREEQCPP.
	
	Example of dumped keywords:
	
	MIX        1

	Added -cells option to DUMP.
	
	DUMP
		-cells 1-19 20
		
	This -cells option will dump any reactant with numbers
	between 1 and 20, including SOLUTIONs, EXCHANGERs,
	GAS_PHASEs, KINETICS, SOLID_SOLUTIONs, SURFACEs, REACTIONs, 
	REACTION_TEMPERATUREs, and MIXes.
	
	
	--------
	svn 3730
	--------
	
	Added keyword RUN_CELLS. 
	
	RUN_CELLS 
		-cells 1 2
		       5-6
		       7
		-time_step   10000
		-start_time  100
		
	
	For each i listed in -cells
	it is the equivalent of the following:
	
	USE solution i
	USE equilibrium_phases i
	USE exchange i
	USE surface i
	USE solid_solution i
	USE gas_phase i
	USE kinetics i
	USE reaction i
	USE reaction_temperature i
	SAVE solution i
	SAVE equilibrium_phases i
	SAVE exchange i
	SAVE surface i
	SAVE solid_solution i
	SAVE gas_phase i
	
	If MIX i is defined, it is used in place of USE solution i.
	A MIX i or SOLUTION i must be defined to use RUN_CELLS; -cells i.
	All other entities are used only if they are defined. 
	
	-start_time and -time_step are needed if any kinetic reactions
	are calculated. -start_time is the time at the start of the 
	calculation, and -time_step is the length of time over which 
	to integrate the kinetic reactions. 
	
	--------
	svn 3727
	--------
	Added keywords to allow modification of each reactant.
	A reactant must have been defined previously, but then
	each data item of the reactant can be changed and new
	components added. Data items read are changed, all 
	other data items remain the same. Input format is the 
	same as the RAW formats produced by DUMP. 
	
	
	New keywords are as follows:
	
	SOLUTION_MODIFY
	EQUILIBRIUM_PHASES_MODIFY
	EXCHANGE_MODIFY
	SURFACE_MODIFY
	SOLID_SOLUTIONS_MODIFY
	GAS_PHASE_MODIFY
	KINETICS_MODIFY
	
	The example below is indented to indicate which 
	information is necessary to change a data item.
	Working back through the indentation levels for
	and item, each heading of a lower order is 
	necessary to define the data item. In the example
	below, to change the number of moles of barite from
	10 to 5 in the equilibrium phase assemblage, it 
	is necessary to define EQUILIBRIUM_PHASES_MODIFY 1; 
	-component; -name Barite; -moles 5. 
	
	Items identified by an asterisk are most likely to
	consider for redefinition. Items with (*) are
	marked to indicate that care is needed to maintain
	charge balance relations. Unwanted redox and pH
	reactions may result from incorrect redefinition
	of these quantities. Items not marked are either
	initial estimates of variables calculated in the
	simulation, or are parameters thought not likely
	to be changed.
	
	The MODIFY data blocks change the data in the
	PHREEQC storage structures. They do not cause
	any initial composition calculations. Neither 
	do they generate default reactions to be simulated.
	USE statements are needed to specify explicitly
	the desired reactions.

	Added DUMP keyword. Writes complete data for solution,
	equilibrium_phases, exchange, surface, solid solution,
	gas phase, and kinetics classes. The format of the
	output is suitable for data input to the C++ version
	of PHREEQC. This feature allows the chemical state 
	of a simulation	to be saved and read back in as 
	initial conditions for subsequent model runs.
	
	Examples:
	DUMP
		-all
		-file    myfile.dmp

	Explanation:
	The first DUMP datablock will write the compositions at 
	the end of the simulation (after all simulation calculations,
	TRANSPORTs, SAVEs, and COPYs are complete) for 
	every solution,	equilibrium_phases, exchange, surface, 
	solid solution, gas phase, and kinetics entities that have
	been defined or produced in the run. This write includes
	internally saved entities (usually assigned negative numbers).
	
	The second DUMP data appends the compositions of items
	numbered 1-3 to myfile.dmp, if they exist. The second example
	shows multiple ways to define the entities to be dumped to
	file.

	------
	Begin
	------
	PHREEQC++ has classes that are equivalent to the PHREEQC C 
	structures. Each class has a method to "dump_raw" the 
	entire set of class data. The lines generated by dump_raw
	can be read as keyword data blocks in an input file. The following
	keywords are available in PHREEQC++: SOLUTION_RAW, 
	EQUILIBRIUM_PHASES_RAW, EXCHANGE_RAW, SURFACE_RAW, 
	SOLID_SOLUTIONS_RAW, GAS_PHASE_RAW, and KINETICS_RAW. 
	PHAST uses these classes and data blocks to dump the chemical
	state of a simulation and read it back in as a starting
	point for subsequent simulations. 
	
	Examples of raw output are given below. Some of the fields
	are required and some are not.

Version 2.18.3: April  10, 2011
------------------------------------------------------------         
	    --------
	    svn 5570
	    -------- 
	    If -high_precision is set to true in SELECTED_OUTPUT,
	convergence tolerance is set to 1e-12. If 
	-high_precision is set to false, convergence tolerance
	is not changed. KNOBS; -convergence_tolerance sets the
	convergence tolerance to a specified number. The last
	definition (-high_precision true or
	-convergence_tolerance) takes precedence for a
	calculation.
	    
------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.18.0: April  9, 2011
------------------------------------------------------------        
	    --------
	    svn 5212
	    --------
	    Added gfm (gram formula mass) as a synonym to gfw in 
	    reading concentration data for SOLUTION.
	    
	    S(6)  1 gfm 96
	    
	    is equivalent to
	    
	    S(6)  1 gfw 96.

	    --------
	    svn 5170
	    --------
	    Added ceil and floor Basic functions. Ceil(x) is the 
	    smallest integer greater than or equal to x. Floor(x)
	    is the largest integer less than or equal to x. Note
	    that all numbers in Basic are of type double in C. 
	    
	    USER_PRINT
	    10 print ceil(2.8), floor(2.8), ceil(-2.8), floor(-2.8)  
	    
	    This USER_PRINT Basic program has the following output:
	    
	    3            2           -2           -3 


	    --------
	    svn 4988
	    --------
	    Added EOL$ Basic function. EOL$ is the end of line
	    character for whatever operating system you are
	    running. 
	    
	    USER_PRINT
	    10 PRINT "line 1"+EOL$+"line 2"+EOL$
	    
	    The result of this USER_PRINT is
	    
	    line 1
	line 2
	   
	    --------
	    svn 4942
	    --------
	    Added additional parameter in PRINT for status. Writing
	    the status line to the screen can slow calculations
	    substantially under some conditions.
	    
	    PRINT
	    -status (t|f|n)
	    
	    t--Print status line.
	    f--Do not print status line.
	    n--Print status line every n milliseconds.
	    
	    -status 1000 would print the status line every 
	    second.
	    
	    --------
	    svn 4830
	    --------
	    Changed default for exchange species activity
	    coefficients to be equal to the Pitzer
	    aqueous activity coefficients when using Pitzer
	    aqueous model. Default is
	    -pitzer_exchange_gammas true.


------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.17.5: September  7, 2010
------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.17.4: September  2, 2010
------------------------------------------------------------

	    --------
	    svn 4771
	    --------
	    Added synonyms to TOTMOLE: TOTMOL, TOTMOLES
	    
------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.17.3: August 12, 2010
------------------------------------------------------------

	    --------
	    svn 4191
	    --------
	    Added new Basic functions:
	    
	    10 total_Ca_in_moles = TOTMOLE("Ca")
	    
	    TOTMOLE provides the total number of moles of an element
	or element valence state in solution. Special values are
	"water", which gives number of moles of water, and
	"charge", which gives total equivalents of charge
	imbalance in solution (same as Basic function
	CHARGE_BALANCE). In contrast, the Basic function TOT
	returns moles per kilogram of water, or equivalents per
	kilogram of water for TOT("charge").
	    
	    10 O18_permil = ISO("[18O]")
	    
	   
	    ISO gives an isotopic composition in the input units for
	an isotope--permil, pmc, or TU in current version of
	iso.dat. The string argument can be an isotope name, or
	any item defined in the ISOTOPE_RATIOS data block, For
	example, ISO("R(13C)_Calcite") will return the carbon-13
	composition of the calcite solid solution in permil
	because of the definitions in iso.dat.
	    
	    10 D_units$ = ISO_UNITS("D")
	    
	    ISO_UNITS gives the input units for the isotope, D_units$ =
	"permil" in the example. The string argument can be an
	isotope name or an item defined in the ISOTOPE_RATIOS data
	block as explained for the Basic function ISO.
	    
------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.17.0: February 25, 2010
------------------------------------------------------------

	    --------
	    svn 4006
	    --------

	    Changed the calculation of Specific Conductance (SC, uS/cm)
	    to be for the actual temperature of the SOLUTION (in output
	    and in BASIC function SC).
	    Previous versions calculated SC for 25 °C, whereas the
	    complexation model is done at the actual temperature.
	    To obtain SC at 25 °C, use keyword REACTION_TEMPERATURE,
	    for example:
	    
	       SOLUTION 1; K 1; Cl 1; -temp 99
	       REACTION_TEMPERATURE; 25
	       END
	       
	    The following example prints to the selected output
	    file the equivalent conductance in (mmho/cm / eq/L) at
	    20 degrees C for a 1:1 chloride salt solution:

	    USER_PUNCH
	            -head conc eq_EC_20
	            -start
	    10 punch tot("Cl"), SC / tot("Cl") * 1e-3
	            -end

	    where 1e-3 converts from microSiemens/cm to mmho/cm.
	    (The example given with svn 2448 multiplies SC's incorrectly
	    with the ratio of the temperatures.)
	    --------
	    svn 3986
	    --------
	    Added an option for time-substepping in multicomponent
	    diffusion (-multi_D true), keyword TRANSPORT:
	    
	    -time_step 3600 3.0  # 3 time-substeps of 1200 seconds
	     
	    This option is useful to avoid a warning about negative 
	    concentrations that may occur in MCD simulations.
	    
	    --------
	    svn 3902
	    --------
	    Added four basic functions for use only with PHAST. The
	    functions are related to the volume, porosity, and 
	    water saturation of a PHAST finite-difference cell:
	     
	    CELL_VOLUME--The total volume of the cell in liters.
	    CELL_PORE_VOLUME--The void volume of the cell in liters.
	    CELL_SATURATION--The fraction of the void volume filled
	            with water, unitless.
	    CELL_POROSITY--The porosity of the cell, equal to 
	            CELL_PORE_VOLUME / CELL_VOLUME, unitless.
	            
	            
	    For example, in a USER_PUNCH program for a PHAST run,
	    the number of moles of dissolved chloride in a cell is
	    TOT("Cl")*CELL_PORE_VOLUME for confined flow simulations.
	    More generally, the number of moles of dissolved chloride
	    is TOT("Cl")*CELL_SATURATION*CELL_PORE_VOLUME, for confined
	    or unconfined flow.
	     
	    For solids, the number of moles of calcite in the 
	    saturated part of a cell is 
	    EQUI("Calcite")*CELL_SATURATION*CELL_PORE_VOLUME. For 
	    unconfined flow, the solid reactants are distributed 
	    between the saturated and unsaturated part of a water- 
	    table cell. It is a limitation of PHAST that it is not 
	    possible to determine the amounts of solid reactants 
	    in the unsaturated part of a cell. Note that for 
	    steady-state, unconfined flow, the saturation of cells is 
	    constant and the unsaturated part of a water-table cell 
	    is never part of the active domain.
	    
	    --------
	    svn 3600
	    --------
	    A new 1/T^2 term (A5 coefficient) was added for all Pitzer-parameter 
	    temperature expressions.
	    
	    P = A0 + A1*(1/TK - 1/TR) + A2log(TK/TR) + A3*(TK-TR) +
	            A4*(TK*TK - TR*TR) + A5*(1/(TK*TK) - 1/(TR*TR))
	    
	    where TK is temperature in Kelvin. The optional A5 parameter
	    is read following A4.

	    --------
	    svn 3591
	    --------        
	    Added T^2 term to analytical expressions for log k. A T^2 term
	    can now be used in the analytical expressions for any log K. 
	    The analytical expression is as follows:
	    
	    log10(K) = A1 + A2*TK + A3/TK + A4*log10(TK) + A5/TK^2 + A6*TK^2,
	    
	    where TK is in Kelvin. The A6 term is the new addition. The optional 
	    A6 parameter is read following A5.
	    
	    --------
	    svn 3485
	    --------        
	    Added the active fraction model for calculating exchanger
	    compositions described by Appelo (1994), Water Resour. Res. 30,
	    2793-2805. The active fraction model is useful for calculating
	    the decrease of selectivity when concentrations increase (more
	    specific sites being filled first). In the active fraction model,
	    log(K) of an exchange-half reaction depends on the equivalent
	    fraction on the exchanger:

	            log(K) = log_k + a_f * (1 - x_i)

	    where log_k is the log of the equilibrium constant when all the 
	                    sites are occupied by ion i,
	            a_f is an empirical coefficient, and
	            x_i is the equivalent fraction of i.

	    a_f can be defined in EXCHANGE_SPECIES with -gamma after the WATEQ
	    Debye-Hueckel parameters.
	    Example:

	            EXCHANGE_SPECIES
	             Na+ + X- = NaX; log_k -0.5
	             -gamma 4.0 0.075 0.50

	    The association constant for NaX becomes:
	              log(K) = -0.5 + 0.50 * (1 - x_Na)
	              
	    --------
	    svn 3453
	    --------
	    Added Specific ion Interaction Theory (SIT) activity coefficient
	    model as described in Grenthe, Ingmar, Plyasunov, A.V., and
	    Spahiu, Kastriot, 1997, Estimations of medium effects on
	    thermodynamic data, in Modelling in Aquatic Chemistry,
	    Grenthe, Ingmar, and Puigdomenech, Inasi, eds, OECD
	    Publications, ISBN 92-64-15569-4, 724 p. 

	    Implementation is similar to the PITZER implementation, a
	    database with the SIT keyword invokes the SIT activity
	    coefficient model. Currently, No database is provided.

	    The SIT keyword has two identifiers,
	    -epsilon and -epsilon1, where -epsilon gives the pairwise
	    interaction parameters and -epsilon1 gives the linear ionic
	    strength dependency of epsilon, if available. Both parameters
	    allow for temperature dependence with the same expression used
	    in PITZER. The five-term expression for temperature dependence is 
	    as follows:

	    P = A0 + A1*(1/TK - 1/TR) + A2log(TK/TR) + A3*(TK-TR) +
	            A4*(TK*TK - TR*TR),

	    where TK is Kelvin and TR is 298.15.

	    Example:
	    SIT
	            -epsilon
	            Na+             Br-             0.05    #   0.01
	            Na+             Cl-             0.03    #   0.01

	            -epsilon1 # not currently used


	    --------
	    svn 3288
	    --------

	    Additional arguments for the EDL function for the CD_MUSIC 
	    surface complexation model. The values of charge, sigma, and psi 
	    for the 0, 1, and 2 planes can be obtained from the EDL function.

	            EDL("element", "surface") gives the amount of 
	                    element in the diffuse layer for "surface".
	                    not including sorbed species. "surface" should 
	                    be the surface name, not the surface-site name 
	                    (that is, no underscore).

	            Special values for "element" include:
	                    "charge" - surface charge, equivalents. 
	                               For CD_MUSIC "charge" refers to plane 0.
	                    "charge1"- surface charge on plane 1, equivalents
	                               (CD_MUSIC only).
	                    "charge2"- surface charge on plane 2, equivalents
	                               (CD_MUSIC only).                                    
	                    "sigma"  - surface charge density, C/m**2.
	                               For CD_MUSIC "sigma" refers to plane 0.                       
	                    "sigma1" - surface charge density on plane 1, 
	                               equivalents (CD_MUSIC only).
	                    "sigma2" - surface charge density on plane 2, 
	                               equivalents (CD_MUSIC only).  
	                    "psi"    - potential at the surface, Volts.
	                                For CD_MUSIC "psi" refers to plane 0. 
	                    "psi1"   - surface charge density on plane 1, 
	                               equivalents (CD_MUSIC only). 
	                    "psi2"   - surface charge density on plane 2, 
	                               equivalents (CD_MUSIC only).
	                    "water"  - mass of water in the diffuse layer, kg.        
	    --------
	    svn 3189
	    --------
	    Density of solutions is now calculated from the concentrations
	    of dissolved species. The algorithm has been described by Millero 
	    (1974), Millero (2000), Millero (2001) and has been used 
	    successfully by Millero and Lepple (1973), Millero et al (1976), 
	    Fernendez et al. (1982) and Millero (2000) to calculate the 
	    density of seawater, estuaries, lagoons and lakes. 
	    
	    The calculation relies on apparent molar volumes phi(i),
	    for individual aqueous species according to the following formula:
	    
	    phi(i) = phi(i,inf) + s(t)I^0.5 + beta(i)I
	    
	    where phi(i,inf) is the apparent molar volume of species i at 
	    infinite dilution, s(t) is the Debije-Hückel limiting slope, beta(i)
	    is an empirical constant, and I is the ionic strength.
	    
	    s(t) is calculated as a function of temperature. Parameterizations of
	    phi(i,inf) and beta(i) use the following formulas:
	    
	    phi(i,inf) = a + bt +ct^2
	    beta(i) = d + et + ft^2
	    
	    where a, b, c, d, e, and f are empirical constants and t in Celsius.
	    Data input of the constants are in the keyword data block SOLUTION_SPECIES

	    Apparent molar volume parameters have been included in the database
	    phreeqd.dat. Calculations made with this database will include

	    Added option for an equilibrium-phase to precipitate only,

	    "pre" is added at the end of a line defining an equilibrium-
	            phase. No data fields may be omitted. Should not

	    Diffusion through DDL water is multiplied with c_DDL,i / c_i
	    with option -only_counter false. c_DDL,i is the concentration in
	    DDL water, c_i is the concentration in free porewater. (Previous
	    versions used a multiplier of 1).

	    Added -erm_ddl as parameter for aqueous species, to be defined
	    with keyword SOLUTION_SPECIES. erm_ddl (> 0) is an
	    enrichment factor in DDL water calculated with option -donnan:
	            c_DDL,i = c_i * Boltzmann_factor * erm_ddl
	    Example:
	    SOLUTION_SPECIES; Cs+ = Cs+; log_k 0; -erm_ddl 2.1
	    Default: erm_ddl = 1.0.

	    Added optional multicomponent diffusion of cations in interlayer
	    space of montmorillonite to keyword TRANSPORT.
	    In the example,
	            interlayer diffusion is true (default = false), 
	            interlayer porosity is 0.09 (default = 0.1),
	            the porosity where interlayer diffusion stops is 0.01
	             (default is 0),
	            the tortuosity factor is 150 (default = 100).

	            TRANSPORT
	            -interlayer_D true 0.09 0.01 150

	    With interlayer_D true, also -multi_D true (and other
	    parameters) must be set, for example:
	             -multi_d true 1e-9 0.3 0.05 1.0
	    Interlayer diffusion is calculated for the cations associated with X-,
	    defined with keyword EXCHANGE.
	            Mass_transfer = -A * (Dw' / t_f) * c_CEC * grad(beta)
	    A is surface area, A_porewater * (interlayer porosity / free
	            porewater porosity),
	    Dw' is the temperature corrected diffusion coefficient of the
	            aqueous species (defined in SOLUTION_SPECIES),
	            corrected to zero charge transfer,
	    t_f is the interlayer tortuosity factor (-),
	    c_CEC is concentration of total X-, mol(X-) / (L interlayer
	            water). L interlayer water = (L porewater + L DDL-
	            water) * (interlayer porosity / free porewater porosity),
	    grad(beta) is the gradient of the equivalent fraction.

	    --------
	    svn 2969
	    --------
	    Added basic functions that return the activity coefficient of
	    an aqueous species (gamma) and the log base 10 of the activity
	    coefficient of an aqueous species (lg).

	    USER_PUNCH
	            -start
	    10 punch gamma("H+")    # activity coefficient
	    20 punch lg("H+")       # log base 10 activity coefficient
	            -end

	    The functions return zero if the species is not defined for
	    the aqueous model or if the species is an exchange or surface
	    species.

Version 2.15.0: February 5, 2008
------------------------------------------------------------

	    --------
	    svn 2680
	    --------

	    Identifiers for parameters controlling the integration by
	    CVODE have been added in the KINETICS data block. 
	    
	    -bad_step_max     bad_steps
	    -cvode_steps      steps
	    -cvode_order      order

	    -bad_step_max bad_steps--This option was used only in the
	    Runge-Kutta method. Now, the value of this option is used for
	    CVODE as well. The value entered is the number of times that
	    PHREEQC will invoke CVODE to try to integrate a set of
	    rates over a time interval. Default is 500.

	    -cvode_steps steps--The value given is the maximum number of
	    steps that will taken during one invocation of CVODE.   
	    Default is 100.

	    -cvode_order order--CVODE uses a specified number of terms in
	    an extrapolation of rates using the BFD method. Legal values
	    are 1 through 5. A smaller value (2) may be needed if the rate
	    equations are poorly behaved. The default is 5. 

	    --------
	    svn 2457
	    --------
	    Added options to inverse modeling to translate current
	    solution definitions in PHREEQC to a Netpath .lon file and
	    (or) to .pat and model files.

	    INVERSE_MODELING
	       -lon_netpath  prefix

	    At the beginning of the inverse modeling calculation, each
	    solution that has been defined (or saved) to PHREEQC, is
	    written to the file prefix.lon in a format readable by 
	    DBXL (NetpathXL distribution).

	    INVERSE_MODELING
	       -pat_netpath  prefix

	    A NETPATH model file is written for each inverse model that is
	    found. The model files are named prefix-n.mod, where n refers
	    to the sequence number of the model. In addition, a file named
	    prefix.pat is written that contains the solutions associated
	    with each model. The solutions are adjusted in accordance with
	    the deltas calculated for the inverse model. Thus, a solution
	    could be used for model 1 and model 2, but the concentrations
	    could be slightly different for the two models. The solutions
	    are identified by an initial integer corresponding to the
	    sequence number of the model, followed by the solution description.

	    --------
	    svn 2448
	    --------
	    Added calculation of specific conductance. Requires the
	    use of phreeqd.dat, which contains the diffusion coefficients
	    of aqueous species. If phreeqd.dat is used, the specific 
	    conductance (uS/cm at 25 C) is printed in the 
	    "Description of solution". 

	    The Basic function SC returns the value of the specific
	    conductance for the solution at 25 C. The following example 
	    would print to the selected output file the equivalent conductance 
	    in (mmho/cm / eq/L) at 20 degrees C for a 1:1 chloride salt
	    solution:

	    USER_PUNCH
	            -head conc eq_EC_20
	            -start
	    10 punch tot("Cl"), SC / tot("Cl") / 1e3 * .89 * 298 / 293
	            -end

	    where 1e-3 converts from microSiemens/cm to mmho/cm, .89 
	    accounts for the viscosity at 20 C, and 298/293 
	    accounts for the temperature of 20 C.

	    anion/anion of different charge--are included; if false
	    these terms are excluded from all equations. Default is true.

	    --------
	    svn 2270
	    --------
	    Added additional parameters Pitzer activity formulation for
	    neutral species, MU and ETA. MU applies to nnn, nnn', nn'n'',
	    nna, nn'a, nnc, nn'c interactions, where n, n', and n'' are
	    neutral species, a is an anion and c is a cation. ETA applies
	    to ncc' and naa' interactions. Also modified LAMDA for the
	    special case of nn interactions (coefficients in osmotic and
	    ln equations are different than other interaction types).
	    Source of equations is Clegg and Whitfield, 1991, Activity
	    coefficients in natural waters, Chapter 6, in Pitzer, K.S.

	    --------
	    svn 1368
	    --------
(1)     Added multicomponent diffusion (MCD) to transport
	    capabilities. MCD allows different tracer diffusion
	    coefficients for species, but calculates charge balanced
	    transport. In the example, MCD is specified to be true,
	    default tracer diffusion coefficient for species (Dw) is 1e-9,
	    porosity is set to 0.3, porosity limit is set to 0.05, and an
	    exponent of porosity (n) is set to 1.0. Effective diffusion
	    coefficient is defined by the equation: De = Dw * porosity^n.
	    Diffusion stops when the porosity falls below the porosity
	    limit.

	    TRANSPORT
	            -multi_d true 1e-9 0.3 0.05 1.0

	    Added tracer diffusion coefficient to SOLUTION_SPECIES
	    definitions, -dw identifier.

	    SOLUTION_SPECIES
	    H+ = H+
	            log_k   0.0
	            -gamma  9.0     0.0
	            -dw     9.31e-9

(2)     Added phreeqd.dat database with diffusion coefficients (-dw)
	    defined for aqueous species in database directory.

(3)     Added BASIC functions to obtain and modify the porosity
	    in a cell. The functions can be used in BASIC programs
	    defined with keyword RATES, USER_PRINT, USER_PUNCH and
	    USER_GRAPH.

	      get_por(cell_no)              # returns the porosity in cell
	                                    # 'cell_no'

	      change_por(0.21, cell_no)     # porosity of cell 'cell_no'
	                                    # becomes 0.21

(4)     Mobile surface and Donnan option in SURFACE. Mobile surfaces
	    are meant for modeling transport of colloids. Only surfaces with
	    a diffuse double layer can be transported (the ensemble must be
	    electrically neutral). Surfaces related to equilibrium-phases
	    and kinetics cannot be transported.

	    Example 1: Use donnan assumption to calculate the explicit
	    composition of the diffuse layer of surfaces. Thickness of the
	    diffuse layer is defined to be 1e-7 meters. (Default thickness
	    is 1e-8 meters.) Hfo (both sites Hfo_w and Hfo_s) is a surface
	    that is transported with advection and dispersion. The diffusion
	    coefficient of 1e-13 m^2/s is used with option -multi_d true in
	    TRANSPORT. Sfo is an immobile surface (Dw = 0).

	    SURFACE
	            -donnan 1e-7
	            Hfo_w 97.5e-5 600 88e-3 Dw 1e-13
	            Hfo_s 2.5e-5
	            Sfo_w 97.5e-5 600 88e-3 Dw 0
	            Sfo_s 2.5e-5


	    Example 2: Define Donnan calculation information. Thickness
	    of the diffuse layer is 1e-8 meters, and relative viscosity is
	    0.5. Relative viscosity only applies to multicomponent diffusion
	    of solutes in the diffuse layer. (Default viscosity is 1.0.)

	    SURFACE
	            -donnan 1e-8 viscosity 0.5

	    Example 3: Define Donnan calculation information. Thickness
	    of the diffuse layer is 1.5 Debye lengths, maximum fraction of
	    water that can be in the diffuse layer is 0.9. (Default
	    thickness in Debye lengths is 1, default limit is 0.8.)

	    SURFACE
	            -donnan debye_lengths 1.5 limit_ddl 0.9

	    When option '-only_counter_ions' is used in conjunction with
	    with '-donnan', all the co-ions (with the same sign of charge as
	    the surface) will be excluded from the DDL, and will be given a
	    concentration of (near) zero in the DDL.

(5)     Added special BASIC function to change the diffusion
	    coefficient of (part of) a SURFACE, and hence to change the
	    status from mobile to immobile or immobile to mobile.

	    Example 1: take a fraction 0.2 of 'Hfo', rename it to
	    'Sorbedhfo', with a diffusion coefficient of 0, in cell 'cell_no'

	    USER_PRINT
	            10 print 'Changing surface in cell ', cell_no
	            20  change_surf("Hfo", 0.2, "Sorbedhfo", 0, cell_no)


	    Example 2: change the diffusion coefficient of 'Hfo' to  1e-12
	    m2/s in cell 'cell_no'

	            10 change_surf("Hfo", 1, "Hfo", 1e-12, cell_no)

	    This function can be used in BASIC programs defined with keywords
	    RATES, USER_PRINT, USER_PUNCH and USER_GRAPH. For correct
	    operation of 'change_surf', the surface components must have
	    been defined with the same surface species (the association
	    constants may differ) and the same diffuse layer thickness or
	    Debye length. The surfaces will be adapted at the end of a
	    calculation step. The result of change_surf does not show up in
	    print or punch results of that step, but the reformatting is
	    effective in the next timestep calculations.


	    --------
	    svn 1337
	    --------
	    Added -add_logk to NAMED_EXPRESSIONS keyword.

	    NAMED_EXPRESSIONS
	    Log_alpha_14C_CO3-2/CO2(aq)
	    -add_logk       Log_alpha_14C_CO3-2/CO2(g)      1

	    --------
	    svn 1281
	    --------
	    Added new option to PITZER data block to allow definition of
	    alpha1 and alpha2 for specific electrolytes. Entries are 
	    following -ALPHAS are Ion1, Ion2, alpha1, alpha2. Both
	    alpha1 and alpha2 should be defined. Default is 0.0 for
	    undefined values following Ion1 and Ion2.

	    Example:

	    PITZER
	    -ALPHAS
	    #
	    # Defaults for ion valences in salts
	    #
	    #   1-N (only B1): alpha1 = 2 
	    #   2-2:           alpha1 = 1.4  alpha2 = 12.0
	    #   3-2, 4-2:      alpha1 = 2    alpha2 = 50
	    #
	    #Ion1     Ion2      Alpha1   Alpha2

	    --------
	    svn 1279
	    --------
	    Added new Basic function OSMOTIC that returns the
	    osmotic coefficient if the Pitzer model (PITZER keyword data
	    block) is used or 0.0 if the ion-association model is used.

	    Example:

	    USER_PRINT
	    10 PRINT "Osmotic coefficient: ", OSMOTIC


	    --------
	    svn 1245 
	    --------
	    Enabled redox in Pitzer model with option in
	    PITZER keyword. Typically, the option will be included
	    in the pitzer database file. 

	    Example:

	    PITZER
	    -redox  TRUE

	    The default database for the Pitzer model does not contain 
	    any redox definitions and the default value for the option 
	    is FALSE. At a minimum, species O2 and H2 must be defined 
	    in the database or input file to allow redox calculations.
	    
	    --------
	    svn 1207 
	    --------
	    Added option to force an equilibrium phase to be 
	    included in the equality constraints. Normally, the SIs of 
	    equilibrium phases are optimized to be negative and the
	    sum of SIs is minimized. If -force_equality is used, then
	    the phase must reach its target SI or the calculation fails
	    with an error.

	    Example: 

	    EQUILIBRIUM_PHASES
	    Fix_pH  -7  NaOH
	         -force_equality
	    Calcite  0
	    Dolomite 0
	    CO2      -3.5

	    One example of using the new option would be to ensure that 
	    a target pH is attained, as in the example above. 

	    --------
	    svn 1179 
	    --------
	    New option (-sites_units or -sites) allows alternative
	    units (sites/nm^2) for definition of number of sites for a
	    surface. This approach requires better consistency among the
	    parameters as both the number of sites and the surface area
	    are based on the mass. It makes more sense than the default,
	    which requires the number of sites (first numeric item in a
	    line) to be defined in units of moles, independently of the
	    number of grams of sorbent. Units descriptor is either DENSITY, 
	    for defining number sites/nm^2, or ABSOLUTE, for defining 
	    number of sites in moles. Optionally, sites, sites_units, or 
	    -s[ites_units]. ABSOLUTE is the default for backward 
	    compatibility with input files.

	    Example:

	    SURFACE 1
	    -sites_units     DENSITY
	    SurfOH  2.6    600.    1.0
	    SurfaOH 2.6    30.     2.0

	    Explanation: 

	    In this example, Surf has a site density of 2.6 sites per
	    nanometer squared, a specific area of 600 meters squared per
	    gram, and a mass of 1 gram. Surfa has a site density of 2.6
	    sites per nanometer squared, a specific area of 30 meters

	    Allows solids and gases in the equations for PHASES. This
	    capability simplifies the definitions for gas and solid
	    isotopic components. Solids must be identified with "(s)" and
	    gases with "(g)". The first entity on the left- hand-side of
	    the equation must be the stoichiometric formula of the solid
	    or gas component being defined, optionally with (g) or (s). In
	    turn gases and solids included in the equation must be defined
	    with reactions that ultimately allow the defined species
	    (C[18O]2(g) in this case) in terms of aqueous species.

	    Example:

	    PHASES
	    C[18O]2(g)
	            C[18O]2(g) + CO2(g) = 2CO[18O](g)

	    CD_MUSIC sorption model has been implemented.
	    Still missing logic for surfaces related to equilibrium-
	    phases and kinetics. Has explicit calculation of diffuse
	    layer composition with Donnan assumption. Old diffuse-layer
	    calculation will not be implemented.
	    
	    Example:

	    SURFACE
	    Goe_uniOH .000552 96.387 1
	         -capacitance    1.1   5
	    Goe_triO  .000432
	    -cd_music
	    -donnan

	    Explanation:

	    1.1 5 are capacitances for the cd-music model for 0-1 and 1-2
	        planes, respectively. 
	    -cd_music specifies that the surface is a cd-music surface.
	    -donnan optionally calculates the diffuse layer composition
	            with the Donnan model.

	    Example:

	    SURFACE_SPECIES
	    Goe_uniOH-0.5 + H+ + AsO4-3 = Goe_uniOAsO3-2.5 + H2O
	         log_k     20.1                 # eq 7   K1, Kin1
	         -cd_music  -1 -6 0 0.25 5

	    Explanation:

	    -cd_music--this option is used to specify the change in charge
	    by the reaction for three planes, 0 (specific sorption at the
	    surface), 1 (Stern layer), and 2 (or d, the diffuse layer).
	    The five numbers in the form above are (1) the change
	    in charge for plane 0 due to loss or gain of hydrogen and
	    oxygen at plane 0, (2) the change in charge for plane 1 due to
	    the hydrogen and oxygen in the ligand that are located at
	    plane 1, (3) the change in charge in diffuse layer, plane 2,
	    (4) the fraction of the central ion charge that is
	    associated with plane 0, and (5) the charge on the central
	    ion.

	    In this example the change in charge at plane 0 is (delta z0) =
	    -1 (loss of one hydrogen) + 0.25*5 (contribution from As+5) =
	    0.25. The charge at plane 0 becomes -0.5 + 0.25 = -0.25.
	    The change in charge at plane 1 is (delta z1) = -6 (3 oxygens of
	    the ligand are located at plane 1) + (1-0.25)*5 (contribution
	    from As+5) = -2.25. The charge at plane 1 becomes 0 + (-2.25) =
	    -2.25. There is no change in charge associated with plane 2.
	    The total charge of the species is -0.25 (plane 0) + -2.25
	    (plane 1) + 0 (plane 2) = -2.5.

	    Alternatively to the form above, the changes in charge 
	    on the three planes can be entered directly as the first 
	    three numbers in the option, followed by two zeros. Thus, the
	    following is equivalent to the -cd_music definition above, and
	    consistent with more recent papers which would list
	    delta z0 = 0.25, delta z1 = -2.25 and delta z2 = 0:

	    SURFACE_SPECIES
	    Goe_uniOH-0.5 + H+ + AsO4-3 = Goe_uniOAsO3-2.5 + H2O
	         log_k     20.1                 # eq 7   K1, Kin1
	         -cd_music 0.25  -2.25  0  0  0

	    Added PRINT option to print the species that contribute
	    to alkalinity. Alkalinity distribution is printed in
	    the output file following the distribution of species.
	    Default at program startup is false.

	    Example:

	    PRINT
	            -alkalinity true

------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.12:
------------------------------------------------------------

*       Made aqueous activity coefficients the default activity
	    coefficients for exchange species when using the 
	    Pitzer formulation. New option in EXCHANGE is
	    -pitzer_exchange_gammas T/F, default is true; 
	    defining "false" sets exchange activity coefficients
	    to 1.0. Option has no effect for ion-association
	    model (non-Pitzer).


*       Added multiplier format to REACTION steps and KINETICS steps, 
	    which simplifies definition of multiple equal reaction increments.

	        This definition:

	               INCREMENTAL_REACTIONS true
	               REACTION
	                    H2O 1
	                    -36 3*-4 2*-.25 -0.19 4*-0.1 3*-0.05 moles

	        is equivalent to this definition:

	               INCREMENTAL_REACTIONS true
	               REACTION
	                    H2O 1
	                    -36 -4 -4 -4 -.25 -.25 -0.19 -0.1 -0.1 -0.1
	                    -0.1  -0.05 -0.05 -0.05  moles

	    

*       Added Pitzer activity formulation. Use pitzer.dat database
	    to invoke the Pitzer model. Should have same capabilities
	    as ion-association model except explicit diffuse layer 
	    calculation is not implemented with the Pitzer model.
	    New keyword is PITZER with following options:

	    A five-term expression for temperature dependence is available
	    for all Pitzer parameter values: 
	        P = A0 + A1*(1/TK - 1/TR) + A2log(TK/TR) + A3*(TK-TR) +
	            A4*(TK*TK - TR*TR),
	    where TK is Kelvin and TR is 298.15.

*       Cl1mp is a new multiple precision version of routine cl1,
	    a simplex-based optimization routine. Cl1mp was develeped
	    by using the Gnu Multiple Precision package (gmp).
	    Calculations are carried out to about 30 significant
	    digits. Cl1mp may help in some situations where roundoff 
	    errors are a problem, but it is still possible that roundoff 
	    errors will cause cl1mp to fail to find a solution to an 
	    optimization problem. The mp version has the following 
	    options in INVERSE_MODELING:

	            -multiple_precision T/F--causes the mp version 
	                    to be used in inverse modeling calculations.
	            -mp_tolerance 1e-12--tolerance for mp version of
	                    cl1. As in cl1, numbers less than the
	                    tolerance are considered to be zero. 
	                    1e-12 is the default.
	            -censor_mp 1e-20--as calculations occur in the
	                    linear equation array, elements less
	                    than this value are set to zero. Default
	                    is 1e-20. A value of 0.0 causes no
	                    censoring to occur.

	    b$ = PAD(a$, 20)   pads a$ to a total of 20 characters
	            with spaces and stores result in b$. PAD returns
	            a copy of a$ if a$ is more than 20 characters.

	            a$ and stores result in b$.
	    b$ = TRIM(a$)     trims white space from beginning and
	            end of string a$ and stores result in b$.


*       Added new Basic function SYS that calculates the
	    total amount of an element in all phases (solution,
	    equilibrium_phases, surfaces, exchangers, solid solutions, 
	    and gas phase). KINETIC reactions are not included.
	    The function has two forms: (1) one element name as an
	    argument (variable names are user specified)

	    10 t = SYS("As")

	    the function will return the total arsenic in the system.
	    (2) 5 arguments

	    10 t = SYS("As", count_species, names$, types$, moles)

	    will return the total arsenic in the system to t; count_species--

	    solution, equilibrium_phases, surfaces, exchangers, solid solutions, 
	    and gas phase species; names$--a character array that has the
	    name of each species; type$--a character array that specifies the
	    type of phase for the species, aq, equi, surf, ex, s_s, gas, diff. 
	    Diff refers to the amount of the element in the diffuse layer of 
	    a surface when the explicit diffuse layer calculation is used; 
	    moles--an array containing the number of moles of the element in 
	    the species. The sum of moles(i) is equal to tot.

	    SYS has several special arguments for the form 
	    SYS("arg", count, names$, types$, values)
	            arg     is one of the options listed below.
	            count   is a single numeric value and is the number of elements
	                            in the following arrays.
	            name$   is an array of string values.

	    Removed quotations surrounding strings in state variable.
	    All fields are 12 or 20 places depending on 
	            -high_precision.

	            specified precision.
	    For isotopes, missing value is -9999.9
	    Selected output is updated each simulation.
	            If a species or phase is defined
	            subsequent to the simulation where SELECTED_OUTPUT
	            was defined it will appear in the selected output
	            file in the simulation in which it is defined and
	            in subsequent simulations.

Added strings for each file, which can be extracted from the
	    executable file with the "ident" command.

	    input file. Values are "log10" values.
Example for Basic program:
	    10 PRINT "Log10 KCalcite: ", LK_PHASE("Calcite")
	    20 PRINT "Log10 KCaHCO3+: ", LK_SPECIES("CaHCO3+")
	    30 PRINT " 1000ln(alpha): ", LK_NAMED("Log_alpha_18O_CO2(aq)/CO2(g)")*LOG(10)*1000

NAMED_EXPRESSION--New keyword data block.

	    This data block was implemented to facilitate isotopic
	    calculations.  It allows analytical expressions that
	    are functions of temperature to be defined. The purpose
	    is to separate the fractionation factors from the log
	    K, so that the fractionation factor or its temperature
	    dependence can be easily modified. The named expression
	    can be added to a log K for a species or phase by the
	    -add_logk identifier in SOLUTION_SPECIES
	    EXCHANGE_SPECIES, SURFACE_SPECIES, or PHASES data
	    block. Log K, Delta H, and analytical expressions for a 
	    log K can be defined with identifiers -log_k, -delta_h,
	    and -analytical_expression as described in SOLUTION_SPECIES
	    in WRIR 99-4259. Fractionation factors are often defined
	    as 1000*ln(alpha). The identifier -ln_alpha1000 can be used
	    to enter data in this form. The analytical expression is the
	    same as defined in SOLUTION_SPECIES, but the result of the 
	    expression is converted to log10(alpha) by dividing by 
	    1000*ln(10) before it is summed into log K values.

------------------------------------------------------------
Added identifier -add_logk to SOLUTION_SPECIES
	    EXCHANGE_SPECIES, SURFACE_SPECIES, and PHASES data
	    block.

	    Allows a named expression to be added to the definition
	    of the log K for a species or phase. In the following
	    example, the log K for the phase Ca[14C][18O]3 is summed from
	    four parts, one defined with the log_k identifier and the
	    other three parts from expressions defined in NAMED_EXPRESSIONS.
	    The named expression is multiplied by the coefficient at the
	    end of the line before it is summed into the log K. A missing
	    coefficient is 1.0 by default.

SOLUTION keyword:
	    At present, can only define isotopes in the units defined in ISOTOPES.

------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.6:
------------------------------------------------------------

	    No new features.

------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.5:
------------------------------------------------------------
Added the capability to use square brackets to define an
	    "element" name. The brackets act like quotation marks
	    in that any character string can be used within the 
	    brackets as an element name. For example, [Fe3], [13C],
	    and [N5] are now legal "element" names. All element 
	    names without brackets must begin with a capital letter, 
	    followed by zero or more lower case letters and underscores.

Added identifier -activity_water for a species in SOLUTION_SPECIES
	    data block. This identifier has been added for future updates
	    that will allow isotopic calculations. It is intended to be
	    used only for isotopic variations of H2O, like D2O or 
	    H2[O18]. It forces the activity coefficient for the 
	    species to be activity(water)/55.5. This effectively sets 
	    the activity of the species to the mole fraction in 
	    solution.

Added identifier -bad_step_max to KINETICS data block.
	    An integer following -bad_step_max gives the maximum number 
	    of times a rate integration may fail before execution of the
	    program is terminated. Default is 500.

------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.4:
------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------
Added identifier -warnings to PRINT keyword. 

	    An integer following -warnings gives the maximum number 
	    of warnings to print into the output file. A negative 
	    number allows all warnings to be printed.

	    Example:        -warnings 20

------------------------------------------------------------
Changed the results of the function CELL_NO in Basic programs.

	    Function cell_no in Basic now prints a number equivalent 
	    to -solution in SELECTED_OUTPUT data block. It gives the 
	    solution number for initial solution calculations and the 
	    solution being used in batch reaction calculations. 
	    Result is the same as previous versions for ADVECTION or 
	    TRANSPORT calculations.

------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.3:
------------------------------------------------------------
DATABASE--New keyword data block

	    It must be the first keyword in the input file. 
	    The character string following the keyword is 
	    the pathname for the database file to be used
	    in the calculation. The file that is specified
	    takes precedence over any default database
	    name, including environmental variable
	    PHREEQC_DATABASE and command line arguments.

LLNL_AQUEOUS_MODEL_PARAMETERS--New keyword data block

	    Added new keyword to make aqueous model similar to
	    EQ3/6 and Geochemists Workbench when using
	    llnl.dat as the database file. Values
	    of Debye-Hückel a and b and bdot (ionic strength
	    coefficient) are read at fixed temperatures.
	    Linear interpolation occurs between temperatures.

	    New options for SOLUTION_SPECIES are
	            -llnl_gamma  a   , where a is the ion-size parameter.
	            -co2_llnl_gamma  , indicates the temperature dependent
	                    function for the bdot term given in 
	                    -co2_coefs of LLNL_AQUEOUS_MODEL_PARAMETERS
	                    will be used. Applies to uncharged
	                    species only.

------------------------------------------------------------
Added function SURF to Basic.

	    SURF("element", "surface") gives the amount of element 
	    sorbed on "surface". "surface" should be the surface 
	    name, not the surface-site name (that is, no underscore).

------------------------------------------------------------
Allow decimals in definition of secondary master species.

	    Some redox states do not average to integers,
	    for convenience in identifying them, decimal numbers
	    may be used within the parentheses that define the 
	    redox state, example S(0.3) could be used in the
	    MASTER_SPECIES data block for the valence state of
	    aqueous species S6-2.

------------------------------------------------------------
Eliminate echo of input file in PRINT data block. 

	    -echo_input T/F turns echoing on and off. 
	    Default is true, initial value is true.
	    
------------------------------------------------------------
Added option for an equilibrium-phase to dissolve only. 
	    "dis" is added at the end of a line defining an equilibrium-
	            phase. No data fields may be omitted. Should not
	            be used when adding an alternative reaction.
	    Example:
	            EQUILIBRIUM_PHASES
	            Dolomite 0.0  0.001 dis

------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.2:
------------------------------------------------------------
Added function EDL to Basic.
	    EDL("element", "surface") gives the amount of 
	    element in the diffuse layer for "surface", not
	    including sorbed species. "surface" should be 
	    the surface name, not the surface-site name 
	    (that is, no underscore).

	    Special values for "element" include:
	            "charge" - gives surface charge, equivalents.
	            "sigma"  - surface charge density, C/m**2.
	            "psi"    - potential at the surface, Volts.
	            "water"  - mass of water in the diffuse layer, kg.

	    --------
	    svn 4698
	    --------
	    Modified PHRQ_malloc and PHRQ_free logic. These routines
	    are used in almost all cases.
   
	    --------
	    svn 4694
	    -------- 
	    Initialized variables for V_M structure, rxn->dz (for CD_MUSIC),
	    Fixed problem where definitions in second SIT data block were
	    not added to model.
	    
	    --------

	    netpath.fil or model.fil. 
	    
	    --------
	    svn 4490
	    --------
	Redox had never been enabled for the SIT formulation.
	Added the switch to include the hydrogen balance 
	    equation for SIT.

	    --------
	    svn 4458
	    --------
	    Tweaked the convergence parameters for Pitzer log
	    gamma unknowns. Set a maximum step size for these
	    unknowns. Also changed usage of internal flags
	    for Pitzer calculations related to initial solution
	    calculations. Corrected print of Gamma iterations.
	    
	    --------
	    svn 4399
	    --------
	    Error in PHRQ_calloc. Size of allocated block was
	    not set. Under some situations, could cause serious
	    errors and a crash.

------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.17.0: February 25, 2010
------------------------------------------------------------
	    --------
	    svn 4115
	    --------
	    Fixed bugs with uninitialized strings in Basic, which
	    caused an error in renumbering with PhreeqcI. Tested
	    most Basic functions. Fixed bugs with LG and GAMMA 
	    functions, which did not return the correct values
	    for H+. GET_POR now returns 0 if it is not a TRANSPORT
	    calculation.


	    --------
	    svn 4066
	    --------
	    Fixed bug with SIT calculations (and Pitzer). The
	    number of solver iterations was too few (200). With
	    SIT and Pitzer, each species has an unknown, so the
	    number of unknowns is large for a system with many
	    elements. Now set the maximum iterations to be 
	    equal to the number of unknowns plus the number of
	    equations/inequalities. 

	    --------
	    svn 4023
	    --------
	    Trapped error when -mole_balance option was used in
	    SOLUTION_SPECIES and one of the stated elements was 
	    not defined. 
	    
	    --------
	    svn 4022
	    --------   
	    Redefined CN- and SCN- to be new elements Cyanide and
	    thiocyanate in llnl.dat. Former definitions were not 
	    useful because cyanide and thiocyanate were never
	    stable and defining a master species as CN- caused
	    problems with mole balances, appearing in solutions
	    without any carbon. 
	    
	    --------
	    svn 3901
	    --------
	    Error with equations that included (s) or (g). The
	    equation and log K were correct only for the simulation
	    when initially read. Now equations an log Ks are correct
	    for all simulations. Calculates saturation index from
	    the equation after (s) and (g) are eliminated. 
	    
	    
	    --------
	    svn 3695
	    --------
	    For transport calculations, fixed step_fraction when 
	    nmix == 1 and ishift == 0.
	    
	    --------
	    svn 3684
	    --------
	    Added more precision in writing dump file fields.
	    
	    Multiple REACTIONS were not sorted correctly. Added sort
	    routine to tidy.c.

	    --------
	    svn 3640
	    --------
	    Print correct temperature for gas phase dump.
	    
	    Correct total moles of exchanger for function sys("X").
	    
	    --------
	    svn 3568
	    --------
	    minteq.dat: Changing log K of gypsum to minteq version 
	    4 value (-4.61). Old value (-4.848) is too stable.

	    --------
	    svn 3483
	    --------
	    Alkalinity is now printed to the selected output file 
	    when the Alkalinity is used with -totals.
	    
	    SELECTED_OUTPUT; -totals Alkalinity 
	    
	    Modified numerical method to attempt to produce a numerical 
	    solution when complexes are extremely strong. llnl.dat As and F
	    complexes caused PHREEQC to fail on an initial solution 
	    calculation. The terms of the As and F mass balance equations
	    were identical to machine precision. One unknown log activity
	    was adjusted but the other was not. Now attempts an adjustment 
	    for the unadjusted log activity.
	    

	    --------
	    svn 3463
	    --------
	    Modified handling of not-a-number in places that 
	    affected the adjustment of log activities (reset and 
	    revise guesses). Uses isfinite function that is available 
	    on Linux and is ifdef'd in global.h for Visual Studio. 
	    The NaN problem occurred rarely and was related to 
	    bad results from the solver and when poor estimates were
	    available in revise_guesses. Also insured that log activity
	    for new master species was well defined in switch_bases.

	    --------
	    svn 3446
	    --------
	    Fixed errors in casting for long double version.

	    --------
	    svn 3440
	    --------
	    Adjusted numerical calculation to avoid extremely large
	    calculated specific conductances in high ionic strength
	    waters.

	    --------
	    svn 3433
	    --------
	    -dw and -millero added to phreeqc.dat, which allows
	    calculation of specific conductance and density.
	    phreeqd.dat is now redundant and removed from distribution.

	    --------
	    svn 3425
	    --------
	    Added error message to require -multi_d for transport of
	    surfaces.

	    --------
	    svn 3424
	    --------
	    Checked for misspellings in EXCHANGE definitions, which
	    previously caused crash.

	    --------
	    svn 3423
	    --------
	    -dw and -millero added to pitzer.dat, which allows
	    calculation of specific conductance and density.

	    --------
	    svn 3292
	    --------
	    Removed redundant warnings related to transport of exchanger
	    and surface.

	    --------
	    svn 3287
	    --------
	    Fixed error in CD_MUSIC surface complexation model. 
	    If reaction equation for a surface species was not
	    written with the primary surface species, the calculation
	    was incorrect. The logic to accumulate the change in
	    charges on the planes was erroneously not included when
	    rewriting the equations to the master species. 

	    --------
	    svn 3247
	    --------
	    Revised donnan layer calculation with CD_MUSIC. Fixed
	    a bug related to moles versus concentration and stream
	    lined calculation. Minor differences in relevant test
	    cases.
	    
	    --------
	    svn 3207
	    --------
	    Modifications to convergence criteria for surfaces
	    related to minerals, when moles of mineral is near
	    zero (<= 1e-14).

	    --------
	    svn 3100
	    --------
	    Error when multiple surfaces were used. Sometimes the
	    surface area from one surface was used for another.
	    Results were probably incorrect if the surfaces were
	    not in alphabetical order in their definition in 
	    SURFACE.

	    --------
	    svn 2711
	    --------
	    Cleaned up compiler warnings for functions called 
	    with constant strings.
------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.15.0: February 5, 2008
------------------------------------------------------------
	    --------
	    svn 2386
	    --------
	    Fixed bug for SELECTED_OUTPUT; -activities H2O. The
	    resulting value was -30; now produces the correct

------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.14.3: November 17, 2007
------------------------------------------------------------

	    --------
	    svn 2386
	    --------
	    Fixed bug in routine find_Jstag. Incorrect index (cell_no)
	    caused segmentation violation in rare instances.

	    --------
	    svn 2312
	    --------
	    Added new option to PITZER datablock, use_etheta t/f.

	    --------
	    svn 2279
	    --------
	    Error lost 200 moles of mineral. Should only be a problem
	    in some cases where moles of mineral is greater than 200.

	    --------
	    svn 2270
	    --------
	    Added additional parameters Pitzer activity formulation for
	    neutral species, MU and ETA. 

	    --------
	    svn 2269
	    --------
	    Fixed buffer overrun in SOLUTION_SPREAD when pasting.

	    --------
	    svn 2268
	    --------
	    Fixed error in prep.c where realloc was called instead
	    of PHRQ_realloc, which eliminated a memory leak.

------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.14.2: September 17, 2007
------------------------------------------------------------
	    
	    --------
	    svn 2267
	    --------
	    Fixed logic of memory checking for PhreeqcI. This serious
	    bug makes versions 2.14.0 and 2.14.1 unusable.

------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.14.1: September 5, 2007
------------------------------------------------------------
	    --------
	    svn 2219
	    --------
	    Updated transport.c to adjust transport in diffuse 
	    layer to be charge balanced for MCD calculation.

------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.14.0: August 30, 2007
------------------------------------------------------------
	    -------------
	    svn 2203-2204
	    -------------
	    Revised logic for using phqalloc memory checker. Compiler
	    option USE_PHRQ_ALLOC now turns on memory checker. If
	    USE_PHRQ_ALLOC is defined and NDEBUG is not defined, file name
	    and line number are also used in memory checking. Model.c
	    now uses same compile options as all other files.

	    --------
	    svn 2199
	    --------
	    Initialized variables that caused problems when rerunning
	    simulations in PfW and PhreeqcI.

	    --------
	    svn 2138
	    --------
	    Fixed bugs in MCD calculation related to saving solutions
	    after initialization.

	    --------
	    svn 2055
	    --------
	    Profiled and optimized of code. Automatic string in Basic
	    factor saves many mallocs. Reordered to minimize call to
	    strcmp_nocase in basicsubs.c and xsolution_save. Minimized
	    mallocs for solver.

	    --------
	    svn 2051
	    --------
	    Fixed bugs in MCD calculation.

	    --------
	    svn 2040
	    --------
	    Fixed warnings for type-punned with new gcc. 

	    Reverted to 2.12 for infilling solutions for transport. 
	    Only solutions are used, not additional reactants for solution
	    0 and n+1.

	    Added digits to printout of REACTION stoichiometry.

	    --------
	    svn 1852
	    --------
	    Fixed error in CDMUSIC surface related to a phase.
	    Stoichiometry of H was calculated incorrectly.

	    --------
	    svn 1837
	    --------
	    Initialize flag for MCD calculation. PhreeqcI would
	    do MCD calculation after TRANSPORT was redefined not
	    to do MCD calculation.

------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.13.2: February 1, 2007
------------------------------------------------------------
	    --------
	    svn 1700
	    --------
	    Fixed bug with redox elements in multi_diffusion
	    stagnant zones.

	    --------
	    svn 1683
	    --------
	    Worked on convergence problems when optimizer fails to
	    find a solution. Censored values greater than 1e8.

	    --------
	    svn 1637
	    --------
	    Fixed bug with dissolve only in ADVECTION calculations.

	    --------
	    svn 1629
	    --------
	    Fixed bug with redox elements in multi_diffusions. Added
	    Phreeqc For Windows changes from 2.13.1.

------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.13.1: January 16, 2007
------------------------------------------------------------
	    --------
	    svn 1600
	    --------
	    Fixed logic error that required rebuilding aqueous model
	    when not necessary. Now runs faster (sometimes 3X) than
	    version 2.13.0.

	    --------
	    svn 1590
	    --------
	    Removed porosity from one statement to eliminate oscillations
	    in multicomponent diffusion calculation.

	    --------
	    svn 1558
	    --------
	    Dissolve-only option did not work correctly for stagnant cells
	    in TRANSPORT calculations. The moles of equilibrium phases,
	    kinetics, gas_phase, and solid solutions were not initialized
	    at the beginning of each transport step. Thus, the printed values
	    for delta moles for the step in the output and punch file were 
	    incorrect for stagnant-zone cells. "Dissolve only" was
	    always tested relative to the number of moles initially in the
	    cells, not the amount remaining at a given time step.

	    --------
	    svn 1485
	    --------
	    Pitzer version with gas_phase did not work. Added
	    gas_phase and cd_music to numerical derivative routine.



	    svn 1368: (1) Added multicomponent diffusion in transport and
	    SOLUTION_SPECIES. (2) Added BASIC functions to obtain and
	    modify the porosity in a cell. (3) Added mobile surface and Donnan
	    option in SURFACE.  (4) Added special BASIC function to change
	    the diffusion coefficient of a SURFACE, and hence to
	    change the status from mobile to immobile or immobile to
	    mobile.

	    svn 1337: Added -add_logk to NAMED_EXPRESSIONS keyword.

	    svn 1306: Revised printing of distribution of species,
	    pure phase assemblages, and solid solutions to use 
	    longer fields for names. More revisions to logic
	    for using gases and solids in equations for phases.
	    Revised logic for solid solutions with small (1e-25) amounts
	    of component.

	    svn 1282: Fixed bug when gas phase had no gas components.
	    Looked the same as not having a gas phase at all.

	    svn 1245: Enabled redox in Pitzer model with option in
	    PITZER keyword. Typically, the option will be included
	    in the pitzer database file. 

PITZER
	-redox  TRUE

	    The default database for the Pitzer model does not contain 
	    any redox definitions and the default value for the option 
	    is FALSE. At a minimum, species O2 and H2 must be defined 
	    in the database or input file to allow redox calculations.

	    svn 1179: New option (-sites_units density) allows alternative
	    units (sites/nm^2) for definition of number of sites for a
	    surface. This approach requires better consistency among the
	    parameters as both the number of sites and the surface area
	    are based on the mass. It makes more sense than the default,
	    which requires the number of sites (first numeric item in a
	    line) to be defined in units of moles, independently of the
	    number of grams of sorbent.

SURFACE 1
	    -sites     DENSITY
	    SurfOH  2.6    600.    1.0
	    SurfaOH 2.6    30.     2.0

	    In this example, Surf has a site density of 2.6 sites per
	    nanometer squared, a specific area of 600 meters squared per
	    gram, and a mass of 1 gram. Surfa has a site density of 2.6
	    sites per nanometer squared, a specific area of 30 meters
	    squared per gram, and mass of 2 grams.

	    svn 1128: Fixed bug with value of time printed to selected
	    output file when using cvode. Value printed was an
	    intermediate integration time step, not time at end 
	    of integration.
	    
	    svn 1096: Allows solids and gases in the equations for
	    PHASES. This capability simplifies the definitions for
	    gas and solid isotopic components. Solids must be identified
	    with "(s)" and gases with "(g)". The first entity on the left-
	    hand-side of the equation must be the stoichiometric formula
	    of the solid of gas component being defined, optionally with
	    (g) or (s). In turn gases and solids included in the equation
	    must be defined with reactions that ultimately allow the
	    defined species (C[18O]2(g) in this case) in terms of aqueous
	    species.

C[18O]2(g)
	    C[18O]2(g) + CO2(g) = 2CO[18O](g) 
	    log_k           0.602059991327962396                   # log10(4)

	    svn 1092: CD_MUSIC sorption model has been implemented.
	    Still missing logic for surfaces related to equilibrium-
	    phases and kinetics. Has explicit calculation of diffuse
	    layer composition with Donnan assumption. Old diffuse-layer
	    calculation will not be implemented.
	    
	    Example:

SURFACE
	    Goe_uniOH .000552 96.387 1
	              -capacitance    1.1   5
	    Goe_triO  .000432
	    -cd_music
	    -donnan

	    1.1 5 are capacitances for the cd-music model for 0-1 and 1-2
	        planes, respectively. 
	    -cd_music specifies that the surface is a cd-music surface.
	    -donnan optionally calculates the diffuse layer composition
	            with the Donnan model.

SURFACE_SPECIES
	    Goe_uniOH-0.5 + H+ + AsO4-3 = Goe_uniOAsO3-2.5 + H2O
	         log_k     20.1                 # eq 7   K1, Kin1
	         -cd_music  -1 -6 0 0.25 5

	    -cd_music gives the charge contribution of the surface
	              species to the three planes. Plane 0 is
	              -1 + 0.25*5; Plane 1 is -6 + (1-0.25)*5; 
	              Plane 2 (or d) is 0.


	    svn 1030: Fixed bug in transport. Mixing was not printed
	    when using -cvode in kinetics.

	    svn 984: Fixed bug in transport when cell without a
	    surface followed a cell with a diffuse-layer surface.
	    Fixed bug in TOTAL function; code ran of the end of
	    the list of master species; changed logic to recognize
	    the end of the list.

	    svn 874: Fixed bug in check_same_model. Thought surface
	    calculation was the same even though -edl switch was
	    different, which gave irratic results and possible 
	    crash. Now checks more carefully to make sure calculation
	    for surfaces is really the same and reinitializes if
	    not.

	    svn 847: Fixed bug with DESCRIPTION function. Did not
	    give correct solution description for reactions.

	    svn 826: Update tally.c to avoid conflicts in C++
	    version of phast.

	    svn 801: Wrote around underflow in fabs in subroutine 
	    reset. 

	    svn 794: Errors in minteq.v4.dat database. Several redox
	    reactions had delta H listed as kcal instead of kJ. kcal
	    is correct only for the following species H2, NO2-, and
	    NH4+.

	    svn 675:
	    Added PRINT option to print the species that contribute
	    to alkalinity. Alkalinity distribution is printed in
	    the output file following the distribution of species.
	    Default at program startup is false.

	    PRINT
	            -alkalinity true
	    
	    svn 655:
	    IAP and log K printed in Phase assemblage data 
	    block were calculated from reactions rewritten to
	    new master species. Now the original data base 
	    reaction is used to calculate IAP and log K.
	    Also fixed check that ensured all elements of 
	    phase in are in solution before SI is calculated.

	    svn 631:
	    Fixed bug with alternate formula for equilibrium phase,
	    nothing happened if all other equations were satisfied
	    at beginning of reaction calculation.

	    svn 603:
	    Link gmp library statically.

	    svn 601:
	    Fixed statement on multiprecision.

	    svn 581:
	    Fixed bug in PhreeqcI that did not reinitialize
	    Chebyschev parameters leading to incorrect results
	    with Pitzer activity coefficients. Results were
	    correct on first run, but erroneous on subsequent 
	    runs.

	    Added statement to identify multiprecision or
	    standard solver for inverse modeling. 

	    svn 578:

	    Distribution changes. Fixed names in README file.
	    Modified Makefile to use specified version. Split
	    Linux and source distribution procedure.

------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.12 Date: Wed September 28, 2005
------------------------------------------------------------

	    Executables and output files for Sun operating systems
	    are no longer provided.

	    Limited log activities of master species to be greater
	    than the smallest machine precision exponential number.
	    Avoids a matherr exception and allows trial of additional
	    parameter sets to attempt to solve the system of 
	    equations.

	    Made aqueous activity coefficients the default activity
	    coefficients for exchange species when using the 
	    Pitzer formulation. New option in EXCHANGE is
	    -pitzer_exchange_gammas T/F, default is true; 
	    defining "false" sets exchange activity coefficients
	    to 1.0. Option has no effect for ion-association
	    model (non-Pitzer).

	    Edited phreeqc.dat to add -gamma expression for 
	    CdX2 and PbX2. 

	    Replaced O2(g) log K in phreeqc.dat and wateq4f.dat
	    with data from llnl.dat, which appears to be better.

	    Added multiplier format to REACTION increments, which
	    simplifies definition of multiple equal reaction increments.

	               REACTION
	                    H2O 1
	                    -36 3*-4 2*-.25 -0.19 4*-0.1 3*-0.05 moles

	    Added Pitzer activity formulation. Use pizer.dat database
	    to invoke the Pitzer model. Should have same capabilities
	    as ion-association model except explicit diffuse layer 
	    calculation is not implemented with the Pitzer model.


	    Fixed bug in surface sites related to mineral and exchange
	    sites related to mineral. Did not have complete logic to 
	    handle redox valence states in formula for species.

	    Modified to remove non standard usage of va_list.

	    Removed exchange master species from SYS("ex",..)
	    list of species. This species is fictive and should
	    not be included in the list.

	    Changed -redox in SOLUTION so that if one of the
	    redox states of a couple is not defined, then 
	    redox defaults to pe.

	    Fixed buffer overrun in PhreeqcI with SOLUTION_SPREAD, 
	    caused segmenatation fault with lines greater than 
	    500 characters.

	    Added bigger string for some error messages to avoid 
	    access violation in cvode.

	    Changed output_msg to warning_msg for combinations
	    of convergence parameters so that message would
	    be controlled by -warnings identifier.

	    Carriage returns are now stripped from Basic program 
	    statements. Switching files from Windows to Unix sometimes
	    leaves extra carriage returns at the ends of lines, which
	    caused a syntax error for some Basic commands.

	    Two bugs were fixed in inverse modeling. (1) Potential 
	    models are now checked for all equality and inequality
	    constraints. Previously some constraints were not checked.
	    (2) One loop of cl1 did not include the last row when 
	    checking for the pivot element. Also printing of headers
	    was slightly modified for inverse modeling.

	    A new multiple precision version of cl1 was develeped by 
	    using the Gnu Multiple Precision package (gmp). Calculations 
	    are carried out to about 30 significant digits. The mp 
	    version may help in some situations where roundoff errors are
	    a problem, but it is still possible that roundoff errors will 
	    cause cl1mp to fail to find a solution to the optimization
	    problem. The mp version has the following options in 
	    INVERSE_MODELING:
	            -multiple_precision T/F--causes the mp version 
	                    to be used in inverse modeling calculations.
	            -mp_tolerance 1e-12--tolerance for mp version of
	                    cl1. As in cl1, numbers less than the
	                    tolerance are considered to be zero. 
	                    1e-12 is the default.
	            -censor_mp 1e-20--as calculations occur in the
	                    linear equation array, elements less
	                    than this value are set to zero. Default
	                    is 1e-20. A value of 0.0 causes no
	                    censoring to occur.

------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.11 Date: Mon February 7, 2005
------------------------------------------------------------

	    Fixed error in selected output file with mixing reaction. 
	    MIX number was written to two columns, should be one.

	    Fixed memory leak with PAD function.

	    New database minteq.v4.dat has been translated from version
	    4.02 of MINTEQA2. An older version of the MINTEQA2 database is
	    retained in file minteq.dat.

	    Switched version control to subversion. Simplified,
	    reorganized makefiles. 

	    Fixed bug with PRINT; -warnings n. Use of this option 
	    generally eliminated all warning messages instead of
	    all messages after the nth. Default number of warning 
	    messages printed in now 100 per simulation.

	    Fixed memory leaks in cvode that caused phreeqci to crash.
	    Now uses PHRQ_malloc in case of other memory leaks. Also
	    fixed potential memory error with PAD Basic function.

	    Saturation index phases that included water had wrong
	    value if distribution of species, exchange, or surface 
	    not written also.

	    Fixed error message in cvode, if max iterations exceeded
	    the error caused a segmentation fault.

	    Made printing of parameter combination message a warning
	    message so that it could be turned off.

------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.10 Date: Tue November 2, 2004
------------------------------------------------------------

	    Rearranged i/o for PHREEQC and reorganized driver
	    subroutine. The object of these changes is to make 
	    the program more functional as a module for other 
	    programs (PHAST) and eventually to produce a callable 
	    C and Fortran module.

	    Fixed a problem with surface related to a phase, when
	    phase was not part of system (for example, Fe(OH)3a when
	    there is no iron in system.

	    Added convergence parameter set that requires mineral
	    transfers to produce positive concentrations in the 
	    event that negative concentrations have been produced in
	    the prior Newton-Raphson iteration. (Fluorite example).

	    Fixed bug with kinetics formulas; did not account for
	    stoichiometric coefficient correctly when using
	    phase names. Generalized to allow multiple phase
	    names in the -formula definition.

------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.9 Date: Wed September 15, 2004
------------------------------------------------------------

	    In inverse modeling, program terminates if sum of initial
	    solutions and phases is > 32.

	    Fixed bug with isotopes. Log activity estimate after initial
	    solution calculation was inf under some conditions. An initial
	    surface calculation failed when using D.

	    Changed saturation index print out to use reaction and log K
	    defined in PHASES definition. Previously, reaction could be 
	    rewritten to predominant redox species.

	    Fixed incorrect print of elapsed time for kinetics in advection.

	    Added phrqproto.h prototype file and phrqtype.h for
	    switching compilation to long double.

	    Fixed incorrect printout of kinetics delta moles with
	    advection.

	    Added convergence parameter set that skips mineral
	    equations for first 5 iterations. 

	    Added entity_exists for module.

	    Tried to fix bug with mix index incorrect (-2) for
	    mixing with kinetics.

	    Added new keyword COPY that allows a data entity 
	            to be copied from one index to a new index 
	            or to a range of indices. Format is

	            COPY keyword index index_start[-index_end]
	    
	            where keyword is one of the following:
	                            SOLUTION
	                            EQUILIBRIUM_PHASES
	                            EXCHANGE
	                            GAS_PHASE
	                            KINETICS
	                            MIX
	                            REACTION
	                            REACTION_TEMPERATURE
	                            SOLID_SOLUTION
	                            SURFACE

	    Numerical method had a bug with ionic strength, if
	            mass of water was not approximately 1. Routine
	            revise_guesses did not divide by the mass of 
	            water. Also changed check in routine molalities
	            to check by molality, not moles.

	    Fixed a null pointer when surface was related to a
	            mineral and mineral was not in database.

	    Added new Basic functions
	    i = INSTR(a$, b$)  sets i to the character position of
	            string b$ in a$, 0 in not found.
	    b$ = LTRIM(a$)     trims white space from beginning of 
	            string a$ and stores result in b$.
	    b$ = RTRIM(a$)     trims white space from end of string 
	            a$ and stores result in b$.
	    b$ = LTRIM(a$)     trims white space from beginning and
	            end of string a$ and stores result in b$.

	    Added new Basic function SYS that calculates the to
	    total amount of an element in all phases (solution,
	    equilibrium_phases, surfaces, exchangers, solid solutions, 
	    and gas phase). KINETIC reactions are not included.
	    The function has two forms: (1) one element name as an
	    argument (variable names are user specified)

	    10 t = SYS("As")

	    the function will return the total arsenic in the system.
	    (2) 5 arguments

	    10 t = SYS("As", count_species, names$, types$, moles)

	    will return the total arsenic in the system to tot; count_species--
	    the number of species that contain arsenic, including
	    solution, equilibrium_phases, surfaces, exchangers, solid solutions, 
	    and gas phase species; names$--a character array that has the
	    name of each species; type$--a character array that specifies the
	    type of phase for the species, aq, equi, surf, ex, s_s, gas, diff.

	    a surface when the explicit diffuse layer calculation is used; 
	    moles--an array containing the number of moles of the element in 
	    the species. The sum of moles(i) is equal to tot.

	    SYS has several special arguments for the form 
	    SYS("arg", count, names$, types$, values)
	            arg     is one of the options listed below.
	            count   is a single numeric value and is the number of elements
	                            in the following arrays.
	            name$   is an array of string values.

	    Added new Basic function, DESCRIPTION, that has the value
	    defined for the description field of the SOLUTION keyword line. 

	    Added alternative ordinary differential equation solver
	    called CVODE, a set of C routines from the Lawrence 
	    Livermore National Labs. CVODE is part of the SUNDIALS
	    package. CVODE is used in place of the Runge Kutta method
	    when "-cvode true" is used within a KINETICS data block.

	    KINETICS
	            -cvode true

	    Fixed error in SOLUTION_SPREAD, defining -redox
	    did not set the default redox for the solutions
	    that were defined; pe was always used as default.

	    Modified code to allocate space differently for
	    pp_assemblage, exchange, surface, gas_phase, 
	    kinetics, and s_s_assemblage. Enough space is allocated
	    at beginning of distribute_initial_conditions.
	    May speed up phast initialization and make better
	    use of available memory.

	    Changed gfw of water to 18 if isotopes of water are 
	    included. Solvent is [1H]2[16O].

	    Fixed a bug in surface integration where order of ions
	    in the list of g's was incorrect.

	    Pyrite rate was not 0 if supersaturated in phreeqc.dat
	    and wateq4f.dat

	    Segmentation error if a surface species was not 
	    defined with an equation that contained another surface
	    species. In this case, the surface master species
	    had been redefined to be an aqueous species (SOLUTION_SPECIES).

------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.8 Date: Tue April 15, 2003
------------------------------------------------------------

	    Updated arsenic data in wateq4f.dat to be consistent with
	    Archer and Nordstrom (2002).

	    Revised Basic interpreter to allow lines of any length
	    and character strings of any length.

	    Renumbering basic statement that included the function
	    SURF in PhreeqcI caused SURF to be omitted and generated
	    a syntax error. SURF and other functions had not been
	    implemented in PhreeqcI.

	    Fixed a bug in the Basic Interpreter. If elements of
	    a dimensioned variable (character or number) were used on 
	    both sides of an equation, the result was erroneously 
	    stored in the last element of the variable used on the 
	    right-hand side instead of the element specified on the 
	    left-hand side.

	    Using comma in some fields caused an infinite loop.

	    Fixed bug with SOLUTION_SPREAD, Phreeqc was not
	    calculating solution numbers for solution_spread 
	    solutions without solution numbers.

	    Fixed bug with stagnant zone calculations. If solutions
	    not defined for stagnant cells, PhreeqcI crashed.

	    Added new state for calculations, PHAST. Previously
	    phast used the state TRANSPORT, which caused some
	    erroneous results with temperature when TRANSPORT was
	    used in the PHREEQC part of the calculation.

	    Trying to define dump file in TRANSPORT caused a file 
	    opening error. Fixed logic so now can open a file
	    and the name can include blanks.

------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.7 Date: Fri February 14, 2003
------------------------------------------------------------

	    Initialized gfw in elements structure.

	    Fixed bug where "time" would be wrong for initial
	            solution calculation. Needed to initialize
	            rate variables for PhreeqcI.

	    Added print of simulation number to error file for
	            phreeqci

	    Limited printing of cell numbers to output file in advection
	            calculations. Cell numbers only printed if results
	            for cell are going to be printed.

	    PhreeqcI captured status messages for kinetics, which
	            made a very large error file in some cases and
	            a long wait to view the output file in PhreeqcI.
	            Now PhreeqcI does not capture these intermediate
	            status messages.

	    Removed old code related to redirecting error file


	    Corrected error in transport where wrong time step was used
	    for integration.

	    Changes to speed up transport algorithm.

	    Allow file names with spaces in selected_output file name and
	            dump_file name.

	    Modifications to work with RC1 phast log file.

	    Allow any characters in square brackets for element name.
	            - and + and perhaps others caused problems before.

	    Fixed log molality of water in species printout, was
	            equal to log activity of water. Also fixed
	            basic function for LM.

	    Changed solid solution prints to print 0 if solid solution
	            is not present.

	    Fixed bug if no rate name was defined before options
	            in RATES.

	    Fixed warning on Mac compilation in fpunchf.

	    Fixed bug if isotopes were used but H and O isotopes 
	            were not defined.

	    Fixed bug where special initial solution calculations
	            were done at later calculation stages.
	            Needed to set initial_solution_isotopes = FALSE;

	    Fixed problem in C++ if structure name is same as member name.
	            logk member of logk structure was renamed to log_k.

	    Added identifier -add_constant to PHASES, EXCHANGE_SPECIES,
	            SOLUTION_SPECIES, and SURFACE_SPECIES. 

	            -add_constant  -0.301  

	            log K is augmented by the specified constant. 


	    Added punch_isotopes and punch_calculate_values to allow
	            printing isotope ratios and any CALCULATE_VALUES result.

	    Added KEYWORDS:

	    ISOTOPES
	    Element
	    -isotope  isotope_name units standard_ratio
	    -total_is_major  T/F (OPTION IS DISABLED!!)

	    CALCULATE_VALUES
	    Name
	    -start
	    Basic statements, must have SAVE
	    -end

	    ISOTOPE_RATIOS (for printing)
	    Name=Calculate_values_name      Isotope_name

	    ISOTOPE_ALPHAS (for printing)
	    Name=Calculate_values_name      Named_logk=named_expression_name

	    Basic functions:
	    calc_value("calc_value_name")           evaluates a definition of CALCULATE_VALUES
	    lk_named("name")                        log10(K) of definition in NAMED_EXPRESSIONS
	    lk_phase("name")                        log10(K) of definition in PHASES
	    lk_species("name")                      log10(K) of definition in (SOLUTION, EXCHANGE, SURFACE)_SPECIES
	    sum_gas("template","element")           Sum of element in gases with specified template
	                                            template="{C,[13C],[14C]}{O,[18O]}2" includes all CO2 gases
	    sum_species("template","element")       Sum of element in aqueous, exchange, and surface species with
	                                            specified template
	    sum_s_s("s_s_name","element")           Sum of element in a specified solid solution

	    PRINT keyword:
	    -initial_isotopes T/F
	    -isotope_ratios   T/F
	    -isotope_alphas   T/F
	    -censor_species   1e-8    # Omits print of species if less than relative criterion

	    SELECTED_OUTPUT keyword:
	    -calculate_values  name1 name2 ...
	    -isotopes minor_isotope1 minor_isotope2 ....

	    Added functions LK_SPECIES, LK_NAMED, LK_PHASE for Basic
	            interpreter. LK_SPECIES("CaHCO3+") returns the
	            log k for the association reaction for the ion pair
	            CaHCO3+ at the current temperature. The log K is 
	            for the reaction as defined in the database or 
	            input file. Similarly, 
	            LK_NAMED("Log_alpha_18O_CO2(aq)/CO2(g)") returns the 
	            value for the log K at the current temperature using
	            expressions defined in NAMED_LOG_K data block; 
	            LK_PHASE("Calcite") returns the value of log K 
	            for calcite at the current temperature for the 
	            dissociation reaction defined in the database or 
	            input file. Values are "log10" values.
	            Example for Basic program:

	            10 PRINT "Log10 KCalcite: ", LK_PHASE("Calcite")
	            20 PRINT "Log10 KCaHCO3+: ", LK_SPECIES("CaHCO3+")
	            30 PRINT " 1000ln(alpha): ", LK_NAMED("Log_alpha_18O_CO2(aq)/CO2(g)")*LOG(10)*1000

	    Added NAMED_EXPRESSIONS data block. This data block was
	            implemented to facilitate isotopic calculations.
	            It allows analytical expressions that are functions
	            of temperature to be defined. The purpose is to 
	            separate the fractionation factors from the log K, 
	            so that the fractionation factor or its temperature 
	            dependence can be easily modified. The named 
	            expression can be added to a log K for a species
	            or phase by the -add_logk identifier in SOLUTION_SPECIES
	            EXCHANGE_SPECIES, SURFACE_SPECIES, or PHASES data
	            block.

------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.6 Date: Mon April 22, 2002
------------------------------------------------------------

	    PhreeqcI  released.

	    All selected_output is routed through a single routine.

	    Allow "_" inside square brackets, [A_bcd].

	    Fixed bug match_elts_in_species, check for "e-" was wrong.

	    Modified minteq.dat to put CuS4S5-3, Cu(S4)2-3 in
	            in Cu(1) mole balance equations instead of
	            Cu(2). Before the change, the program would 
	            not converge if Cu(2) were defined in an 
	            initial solution.
	            
	    Made revisions hopefully to improve SOLID_SOLUTIONS
	            convergence with small numbers of moles of
	            solids.

	    Made changes related to dump file and PhreeqcI.

	    Iterations now sums iterations in all kinetics calculations

	    Fixed bug with LA("H2O"), which was returning natural log
	            of activity of water.
	    

------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.5  Date: Mon October 1, 2001
------------------------------------------------------------

	    In llnl.dat, fixed sign errors in RRE (rare earth elements) 
	            for some redox reactions and removed some redundant 
	            species, generally ReeO2- was retained and Ree(OH)4- 
	            was removed.

	    Added the capability to use square brackets to define an
	            "element" name. The brackets act like quotation marks
	            in that any character string can be used within the 
	            brackets as an element name. This was introduced to
	            simplify expansion of the model to isotopic species.
	            [13C], [14C], and [18O] are legal element names.

	    Added identifier -activity_water for a species in 
	            SOLUTION_SPECIES data block. This identifier has been 
	            added for future updates that will allow isotopic 
	            calculations. It is intended to be used only for 
	            isotopic variations of H2O, like D2O or H2[O18]. It
	            forces the activity coefficient for the species to be
	            activity(water)/55.5. This effectively sets the activity 
	            of the species to the mole fraction in solution.

	    Fixed bug in checking solid solutions for presence or
	            absence of elements in the system. Programming
	            error caused segmentation fault if an error
	            was detected under certain conditions.

	    Changed return value of MOL to be molality of water
	            if argument is "H2O". Also changed return value
	            of LA to be activity of water if argument is 
	            "H2O".

	    Diffuse layer calculation was incorrect if aqueous phase did not
	            have 1 kilogram of water. Eq. 74 of manual has molality,
	            but code used moles. The code was corrected by adding
	            the mass of water to the formulation.

	    Stagnant zones with first-order exchange approximation (1 stagnant 
	            cell, exchange factor, and porosities defined) did not work 
	            correctly if mobile and immobile cells did not have equal 
	            volumes of water. The mixing factors were revised to account
	            for the masses of water in the stagnant and mobile zones.

	    A fatal error was erroneously detected if the database file
	            had a DATABASE data block. DATABASE data block is
	            now ignored while reading the database file.

	    Added identifier -bad_step_max to KINETICS data block.
	            An integer following -bad_step_max gives the maximum number 
	            of times a rate integration may fail before execution of the
	            program is terminated. Default is 500.

------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.4.2: Date: Fri June 15, 2001
------------------------------------------------------------

	    Fixed spreadsheet bug. Program was not ignoring columns
	            that could not be identified as either element 
	            names or allowed data (ph, pe, number, description, 
	            etc). Also, the program failed if a spreadsheet solution
	            number was negative.

------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.4.1: Date: Mon June 4, 2001
------------------------------------------------------------

	    Fixed spreadsheet bugs with isotopes.

------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.4: Date: Fri June 1, 2001
------------------------------------------------------------

	    Added structure for spreadsheet for use by PhreeqcI.

	    Isotope value initialized incorrectly if only an -uncertainty was 
	            defined in SOLUTION_SPREAD.

	    Fixed segmentation violation when primary and secondary master
	            species were defined improperly.

	    Corrected enthalpies of reaction in llnl.dat. Previous release had
	            erroneously had enthalpies of formation in -delta_H
	            parameter; the values should be enthalpies of reaction.
	            Enthalpies of reaction were calculated from the
	            enthalpies of formation and these values are now included
	            in the -delta_H parameter. This change will have very
	            little impact on calculations because the analytical
	            expression has precedence over -delta_H in calculating
	            temperature dependence of log K, and nearly all species
	            and minerals have an analytical expression or lack both
	            an analytical expression and an enthalpy of reaction.

	    Corrected bugs in punch of solid solution components that caused
	            both selected output and output file errors:  moles
	            were incorrect in selected output, and total moles and
	            mole fraction were incorrect in output file.

	    Added surface complexation constants for Fe+2; two complexes for 
	            weak sites and one complex for strong sites.  phreeqc.dat
	            and wateq4f.dat modified.

	    Comment for units of parameters for calcite rate equation was
	            wrong. Rate equation now uses cm^2/L for area parameter. 
	            Previously the correct units would have been 1/decimeter. 
	            phreeqc.dat and wateq4f.dat modified.

	    Fixed a bug when rates were equal within tolerance, but negative
	            concentrations occurred because of small initial
	            concentrations.

	    Added -warnings to PRINT keyword for specification of maximum
	            number of warnings to print. Negative number allows
	            all warnings to be printed.

	    Function CELL_NO in Basic now prints a number equivalent to
	            -solution in SELECTED_OUTPUT data block. This does not
	            change printing for ADVECTION or TRANSPORT calculations.

	    Kinetics time is halved for advective part of reaction in 
	            transport; time incorrectly accounted for before.

	    -punch_ identifiers printed -1 instead of the correct solution 
	            number for batch-reaction calculations.

	    -high_precision is no longer reset to false with every 
	            SELECTED_OUTPUT data block.

	    SELECTED_OUTPUT file name stored for use by PhreeqcI.

	    Alkalinity for NH3 corrected to 1.0 in llnl.dat.

	    Fixed bug with USER_PRINT of kinetics. Did not find correct
	            kinetics information in some cases. 

	    Fixed bug in default values for SOLUTION_SPREAD. Cannot use phase 
	            name and SI for pH or pe, and bug did not allow PHREEQC
	            to run. Now PHREEQC runs, but warns that this is not
	            allowed.

------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.3: Date: Tue January 2, 2001
------------------------------------------------------------

	    Added new keyword DATABASE. It must be the first keyword in
	            the input file. The character string following the
	            keyword is the pathname for the database file to
	            be used in the calculation. The file that is 
	            specified takes precedence over any default
	            database name, including environmental variable
	            PHREEQC_DATABASE and command line arguments.

	    Fixed bug in SOLUTION_SPREAD. If first heading in
	            the spread-sheet input was an identifier--pH,
	            pe, units, etc--then the headings were interpreted
	            as an identifier and bad things happened.

	    Added new keyword to make aqueous model similar to
	            LLNL and Geochemists Workbench when using
	            llnl.dat as the database file. Values
	            of Debye-Hückel a and b and bdot (ionic strength
	            coefficient) are read at fixed temperatures.
	            Linear interpolation occurs between temperatures.

	    New options for SOLUTION_SPECIES are
	            -llnl_gamma  a   , where a is the ion-size parameter.
	            -co2_llnl_gamma  , indicates the temperature dependent
	                            function for the bdot term given in 
	                            -co2_coefs of LLNL_AQUEOUS_MODEL_PARAMETERS
	                            will be used. Applies to uncharged
	                            species only.

	    Fixed bug in basic interpreter. A number like "..524" would
	            cause an infinite loop.

	    Added function SURF to Basic.
	            SURF("element", "surface") gives the amount of 
	                    element sorbed on "surface". "surface" 
	                    should be the surface name, not the 
	                    surface-site name (that is, no underscore).

	    Fixed option to "runge_kutta" from "runge-kutta" to match
	            documentation for KINETICS.

	    Fixed UO2+2 and Mn+2 reaction stoichiometry for Hfo surface complexation
	            in wateq4f.dat.

	    Added option for an equilibrium-phase to dissolve only. 
	            "dis" is added at the end of a line defining an equilibrium-
	                    phase. No data fields may be omitted. Should not
	                    be used when adding an alternative reaction.
	            Example:
	            EQUILIBRIUM_PHASES
	                    Dolomite 0.0  0.001 dis
	    R-K integration failed when only the final rate generated
	            negative concentrations.
	    Allow decimals in definition of secondary master species, for
	            example S(0.3).
	    Fixed bug if description was more than about 85 characters;
	            now allows about 400 characters.
	    Fixed bug for surface/exchange sites related to phases. Was
	            checking internal copies of surfaces/exchange with negative
	            numbers.
	    Fixed bug in quick prep that did not set the correct pointer
	            for gas phases.
	    Fixed segmentation fault that occurred if all elements for
	            phase-boundary mineral were not in the solution.
	            Only applied to a phase used to define concentration
	            in an initial solution calculation.
	    Added option to eliminate echo of input file in PRINT
	            data block. -echo_input T/F turns echoing on
	            and off. Default is on.

Release 2.2: Date: Wed March 1, 2000
------------------------------------------------------------

	    Fixed bug in MIX if no solutions are defined.
	    Changed printout for surface.
	            Only gives net surface charge for diffuse layer 
	                    calculation.
	            Prints correct value for the surface charge and
	                    surface charge density for diffuse-layer 
	                    calculation.    

	    Added function EDL to Basic.
	            EDL("element", "surface") gives the amount of 
	                    element in the diffuse layer for "surface".
	                    not including sorbed species. "surface" should 
	                    be the surface name, not the surface-site name 
	                    (that is, no underscore).

	            Special values for "element" include:
	                    "charge" - gives surface charge, equivalents.
	                    "sigma"  - surface charge density, C/m**2.
	                    "psi"    - potential at the surface, Volts.
	                    "water"  - mass of water in the diffuse layer, kg.
	    Changed distribution to be more consistent with other USGS 
	            water-resources applications.

------------------------------------------------------------
Release 2.1: Date: Wed January 19, 2000
------------------------------------------------------------

	    Added additional #ifdef's for PhreeqcI.
	    Fixed problem with formats for USER_PUNCH and
	            others with Microsoft C++ 3 digit 
	            exponents.
