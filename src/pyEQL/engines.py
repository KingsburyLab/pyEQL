        Whenever the appropriate parameters are available, the Pitzer model [may11]_ is used.
        If no Pitzer parameters are available, then the appropriate equations are selected
        according to the following logic: [stumm96]_.

        I <= 0.0005: Debye-Huckel equation
        0.005 < I <= 0.1:  Guntelberg approximation
        0.1 < I <= 0.5: Davies equation
        I > 0.5: Raises a warning and returns activity coefficient = 1

        The ionic strength, activity coefficients, and activities are all
        calculated based on the molal (mol/kg) concentration scale. If a different
        scale is given as input, then the molal-scale activity coefficient :math:`\gamma_\pm` is
        converted according to [rbs68]_

        .. math:: f_\pm = \gamma_\pm * (1 + M_w \sum_i \nu_i m_i)

        .. math:: y_\pm = \frac{m \rho_w}{C \gamma_\pm}

        where :math:`f_\pm` is the rational activity coefficient, :math:`M_w` is
        the molecular weight of water, the summation represents the total molality of
        all solute  species, :math:`y_\pm` is the molar activity coefficient,
        :math:`\rho_w` is the density of pure water, :math:`m` and :math:`C` are
        the molal and molar concentrations of the chosen salt (not individual solute), respectively.

        Args:
            solute: String representing the name of the solute of interest
            scale: The concentration scale for the returned activity coefficient.
                Valid options are "molal", "molar", and "rational" (i.e., mole fraction).
                By default, the molal scale activity coefficient is returned.

        Returns:
            The mean ion activity coefficient of the solute in question on  the selected scale.

        Notes:
            For multicomponent mixtures, pyEQL implements the "effective Pitzer model"
            presented by Mistry et al. [mistry13]_. In this model, the activity coefficient
            of a salt in a multicomponent mixture is calculated using an "effective
            molality," which is the molality that would result in a single-salt
            mixture with the same total ionic strength as the multicomponent solution.

            .. math:: m_{effective} = \frac{2 I}{(\nu_{+} z_{+}^2 + \nu_{-}- z_{-}^2)}

        all solute  species, and :math:`x_{w}` is the mole fraction of water.

        Args:
            scale: The concentration scale for the returned osmotic coefficient. Valid options are "molal",
                "rational" (i.e., mole fraction), and "fugacity".  By default, the molal scale osmotic
                coefficient is returned.

        Returns:
            Quantity:
                The osmotic coefficient

        Notes:
            For multicomponent mixtures, pyEQL adopts the "effective Pitzer model"
            presented by Mistry et al. [mistry13]_. In this approach, the osmotic coefficient of
            each individual salt is calculated using the normal Pitzer model based
            on its respective concentration. Then, an effective osmotic coefficient
            is calculated as the concentration-weighted average of the individual
            osmotic coefficients.

            For example, in a mixture of 0.5 M NaCl and 0.5 M KBr, one would calculate
            the osmotic coefficient for each salt using a concentration of 0.5 M and
            an ionic strength of 1 M. Then, one would average the two resulting
            osmotic coefficients to obtain an effective osmotic coefficient for the
            mixture.

            (Note: in the paper referenced below, the effective osmotic coefficient is determined by weighting
            using the "effective molality" rather than the true molality. Subsequent checking and correspondence with
            the author confirmed that the weight factor should be the true molality, and that is what is implemented
            in pyEQL.)

        Examples:
            >>> s1 = pyEQL.Solution({'Na+': '0.2 mol/kg', 'Cl-': '0.2 mol/kg'})
            >>> s1.get_osmotic_coefficient()
            <Quantity(0.923715281, 'dimensionless')>

            >>> s1 = pyEQL.Solution({'Mg+2': '0.3 mol/kg', 'Cl-': '0.6 mol/kg'},temperature='30 degC')
            >>> s1.get_osmotic_coefficient()
            <Quantity(0.891409618, 'dimensionless')>
