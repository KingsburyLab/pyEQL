# pyEQL Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.2.0] - 2024-09-24

### Fixed

- Database: removed several erroneous species (such as `CO32-` which was really `CO3[-2]`),
  corrected other parsing errors, and updated formula syntax for consistency with recent
  `standardize_formula` changes (e.g., `H4NCl -> NH4Cl`) (#190, @rkingsbury)

### Changed

- Bump `pymatgen` to `v2024.9.10` for additional upstream formula fixes. (#188, @abhardwaj73)

### Removed

- **BREAKING** - dropped python 3.9 support, in accordance with numpy deprecation policy.
  (#188, @abhardwaj73)

## [1.1.6] - 2024-09-01

### Fixed

- `Solution.get_total_amount`: Bugfix that caused an error when called on certain elements
  without specifying an oxidation state. For example, `get_total_amount('N')` could raise
  an exception in a solution containing `Na` (but no `N`) due to a flaw in a logical
  test.
- `Solution._adjust_charge_balance`: Removed a misleading and redundant log message (#162, @SuixiongTay)

### Added

- `gibbs_mix`: A new keyword argument `activity_correction` was added to `gibbs_mix`. It defaults
  to `True` (no change from prior behavior), but can be set to `False` in order to calculate the
  ideal mixing energy, which is equivalent to only considering entropic effects. (#178, @Jaebeom-P)
- `standardize_formula`: Improve formatting of ammonium sulfate salts. Aqueous ammonium sulfate previously
  standardized to `H8S(NO2)2(aq)`, now it will display as `(NH4)2SO4(aq)`.

### Changed

- **BREAKING** `entropy_mix` now returns the ideal mixing _entropy_ in units of J/K rather than the mixing
  _energy_ in J. This was done to improve clarity with respect to the function name. An `activity_correction`
  kwarg was added to `gibbs_mix` so that you can still calculate the ideal mixing energy by setting it to `False`.
  (#178, @Jaebeom-P)
- Revise documentation of `gibbs_mix`, `entropy_mix`, and `donnan_eql`. (#178, @Jaebeom-P)
- CI: Improve comprehensiveness of CI dependency testing. (#163, #164, @abhardwaj73)

## [1.1.5] - 2024-07-28

### Fixed

- `Solution`: Hotfix to remove a stray `assert` statement in `_adjust_charge_balance`
  that would sometimes cause errors in`pH` charge balancing.

## [1.1.4] - 2024-07-28

### Fixed

- `Solution`: Fix a bug in`pH` charge balancing that erroneously prevented charge
  balancing from occurring in certain cases, and raised an error.

## [1.1.3] - 2024-07-28

### Fixed

- `Solution`: Fix a bug in which setting `balance_charge` to `pH` could result in
  negative concentration errors when charge balancing or after `equilibrate` was
  called. `Solution` now correctly enforces the ion product of water (Kw=1e-14)
  whenever adjusting the amounts of H+ or OH- for charge balancing.

### Added

- `Solution._adjust_charge_balance`: Added a privat helper method to consolidate charge
  balancing code used in `__init__` and `equilibrate`.

## [1.1.2] - 2024-07-28

### Fixed

- `Solution`: Fix a bug in which setting `balance_charge` to `auto` when the initial
  composition was electroneutral would cause errors and/or improper charge balancing
  after `equilibrate` was called.

## [1.1.1] - 2024-07-27

### Fixed

- `equilibrate`: Fixed a bug that could cause an `AttributeError` when pH was used for charge
  balancing.
- Database: `size.radius_ionic` was missing units for `Ni[+2]` and `Cr[+3]`. Correct units have been added.

### Added

- `Solution`: New automatic charge balancing method will automatically identify the majority (highest concentration)
  cation or anion as appropriate (depending on the charge balance) for charge balancing. To use this mode, set
  `balance_charge='auto'` when instantiating a `Solution`.

### Changed

- `Solution.add_amount`: This method will now add solutes that are absent from the Solution. Previously, calling, e.g.,
  `add_amount('Na+', '1 mol')` on a `Solution` that did not contain any sodium would result in an error. A warning
  is logged if the method has to add a new solute.
- Units: use the upstream chemistry context from `pint` instead of the custom one from 2013.
- `pre-commit autoupdate`
- Misc. linting and code quality improvements.
- Unit tests: update `tmpdir` to `tmp_path` text fixture.
- CI: Small updates to pre-commit and GitHub actions per scientific python [repo review](https://scientific-python.github.io/repo-review/?repo=kingsburylab%2FpyEQL&branch=main).

## [1.0.3] - 2024-07-20

### Fixed

- `standardize_formula`: Fix incorrect display of additional formulas, including methane which
  was shown as "H4C(aq)", other tri-anions (N3-, P3-), and a variety of haloacetic acids. For
  example, tricholoracetic acid was previously shown as `'C2Cl3O2[-1]'` but will now display
  as `'CCl3COO[-1]'`.

### Added

- `standardize_formula`: `pyEQL` can now parse ion formulas that contain unicode superscript
  or subscript characters, which makes input even more flexible. For example, `"PO₄³⁻"` and `"Co²⁺"`
  will now standardize correctly to `"PO4[-3]"` and `"Co[+2]"`, respectively.

### Changed

- Housekeeping: move all project configuration to `pyproject.toml`

## [1.0.2] - 2024-07-09

### Fixed

- `standardize_formula`: Fix incorrect display of ammonium/ammonia. Previously, their formulas
  were shown as "H4N[+1]" and "H3N(aq)", respectively. They now correctly display as NH4 and NH3.
  Similar fixes were implemented for HPO4[-2] / H2PO4[-1] / H3PO4, formate (HCOO[-1]), oxalate (C2O4[-2]), thicyanate (SCN[-1]), and triiodide (I3[-1]).
  Fixes #136 (@xiaoxiaozhu123)

## [1.0.1] - 2024-06-17

### Added

- Added `NPY201` ruleset to `ruff` configuration to check support for `numpy` 2.0

### Fixed

- `NativeEOS` and `PHREEQCEOS` `equilibrate`: Fixed a charge balancing bug that cause repeated calls to `equlibrate` to
  severely distort the pH and/or the composition. (#141)[https://github.com/KingsburyLab/pyEQL/issues/141]
- `UnicodeDecodeError` when trying to connect to ion database on non-English platforms ([#122](https://github.com/KingsburyLab/pyEQL/issues/122))

### Changed

- Replace `math` with `numpy` functions throughout. This mainly changed calls to `log` and `exp`.
- Docs: Fix missing close parentheses in docstring (@Andrew S. Rosen)

## [1.0.0] - 2024-03-17

### Added

- `Solution.__init__`: new keyword argument `log_level` allows user to control the verbosity of log messages by setting
  the level (e.g., ERROR, WARNING, etc.) that will be shown in stdout.
- Docs: added a note about a workaround for Apple M1/M2 Macs proposed by @xiaoxiaozhu123

### Changed

- `Solution.__init__`: The deprecated format for specifying solutes (e.g., `[["Na+", "0.5 mol/L]]`)
  which previously only generated log warning message, now raises a `DeprecationWarning`. Use dict-style input (e.g.,
  `{"Na+":"0.5 mol/L"}`) instead.
- New logo! Updated the `pyEQL` logo (for the first time in 9 years!) to address an obsolete font in the .svg
  and modernize the design.

### Removed

- **BREAKING** All methods and functions (with the exception of `Solution.list_XXX` methods) previously marked with
  deprecation warnings have been removed.

## [0.15.1] - 2024-03-13

### Fixed

- `Solution.get_total_amount`: Fixed an issue in which `ppm` units would fail.

## [0.15.0] - 2024-03-13

### Added

- `utils.interpret_units`: New method to "sanitize" environmental engineering units like ppm to strings that `pint`
  can understand, e.g. ppm -> mg/L. This method is now used in `get_amount` and `get_total_amount` to ensure consistency
  in how they process units.

### Changed

- CI: `pre-commit autoupdate`

### Fixed

- `Solution`: Fixed an issue in which repeated calls to `equilibrate` when using `NativeEOS` or `PHREEQCEOS` would
  change the mass of the `Solution` slightly. This was attributed to the fact that `pyEQL` and `PHREEQC` use slightly
  different molecular weights for water.
- `Solution`: `get_total_amount` and related methods could fail when the oxidation state of an element was
  unknown (e.g., 'Br') (Issue [#116](https://github.com/KingsburyLab/pyEQL/issues/116))

## [0.14.0] - 2024-03-05

### Added

- `NativeEOS` / `PhreeqcEOS`: Added `try`/`catch` so that `pyEQL` can still be used on platforms that PHREEQC does
  not support, such as Apple Silicon. In such cases, functions like `equilibrate` that depend on PHREEQC will
  raise errors, but everything else can still be used.
- CI: Added Apple M1 runner (GitHub: `macos-14`) to the CI tests.

### Fixed

- CI: Addressed several issues in the testing configuration which had resulted in testing
  fewer operating systems x python version combinations than intended. CI tests now
  correctly and comprehensively test every supported version of python on every os
  (macos, windows, ubuntu).
- `utils.FormulaDict`: implemented `__contains__` so that `get()` works correctly in
  python 3.12+. See https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/105524
- Docs: fixed many small problems in documentation causing equations and examples to
  render incorrectly.
- `Solution.from_file`: Add missing `@classmethod` decorator; update documentation.

## [0.13.0] - 2024-03-05

### Fixed

- `equilibrium.alpha()`: Fixed incorrect calculation of acid-base distribution coefficient for multiprotic acids.

## [0.12.2] - 2024-02-25

### Fixed

- `Solution.get_total_amount`: Fix bug that would cause the method to fail if
  units with names not natively understood by `pint` (e.g., 'ppm') were passed.

## [0.12.1] - 2024-02-25

### Fixed

- `Solute.from_formula`: Fix bug in which an uncaught exception could occur when
  if `pymatgen` failed to guess the oxidation state of a solute. (Issue #103 - thanks to @xiaoxiaozhu123 for reporting).
- `Solution.get_total_amount`: Fix bug that would cause the method to fail if
  mass-based units such as mg/L or ppm were requested.

## [0.12.0] - 2024-02-15

### Added

- `Solution`: new kwarg `default_diffusion_coeff` which allows the user to specify a value to use
  when a species diffusion coefficient is missing from the database. By default, the value for NaCl
  salt (1.61e-9 m2/s) is used. This is important for conductivity and transport number calculations,
  which perform weighted summations of diffusion coefficients over every species in the solution.
  Previously, species with missing diffusion coefficients would be excluded from such calculations,
  possibly resulting in inaccuracies, particularly after calling `equilibrate()`, which often
  generates charged complexes such as NaSO4- or MgCl+.

### Fixed

- `Solution.__add__`: Bugfix in the addition operation `+` that could cause problems with
  child classes (i.e., classes that inherit from `Solution`) to work improperly

### Changed

- Removed deprecated `pkg_resources` import in favor of `importlib.resources`

## [0.11.1] - 2023-12-23

### Added

- Add tests for `gibbs_mix` and `entropy_mix` functions. Format docstrings in Google style.

### Fixed

- `Solution.from_preset`: Fixed a packaging error that made this method fail with a `FileNotFoundError`.

### Removed

- `functions.py` is no longer imported into the root namespace. You'll now need to say `from pyEQL.functions import gibbs_mix`
  instead of `from pyEQL import gibbs_mix`

## [0.11.0] - 2023-11-20

### Changed

- `PhreeqcEOS`: performance improvements for the `phreeqc` engine. The `EOS` instance now retains
  the `phreeqpython` solution object in between calls, only re-initializing it if the composition
  of the `Solution` has changed since the previous call.

### Fixed

- `equilibrate`: Fixed several bugs affecting `NativeEOS` and `PhreeqcEOS` in which calling `equilibrate()`
  would mess up the charge balance. This was especially an issue if `balance_charge` was set to something
  other than `pH`.

### Removed

- `equilibrium.equilibrate_phreeqc()` has been removed to reduce redundant code. All its
  was absorbed into `NativeEOS` and `PhreeqcEOS`

## [0.10.1] - 2023-11-12

### Added

- utility function `create_water_substance` with caching to speed up access to IAPWS instances

### Changed

- `Solution.get_diffusion_coefficient`: the default diffusion coefficient (returned when D for a solute is not found in
  the database) is now adjusted for temperature and ionic strength.
- `Solution.water_substance` - use the IAPWS97 model instead of IAPWS95 whenever possible, for a substantial speedup.

## [0.10.0] - 2023-11-12

### Added

- `Solution`: Revamped docstrings for `conductivity`, `get_transport_number`, `get_molar_conductivity`, and
  `get_diffusion_coefficient`.
- `Solution`: new method `get_diffusion_coefficient` for dedicated retrieval of diffusion coefficients. This method
  implements an improved algorithm for temperature adjustment and a new algorithm for adjusting infinite dilution D values
  for ionic strengthe effects. The algorithm is identical to that implemented in PHREEQC >= 3.4.
- Database: empirical parameters for temperature and ionic strength adjustment of diffusion coefficients for 15 solutes
- Added tests for temperature and ionic strength adjustment and conductivity
- Docs: new tutorial notebooks
- Docs: remove duplicate contributing pages (Closes [#68](https://github.com/KingsburyLab/pyEQL/issues/68))
- `Solution`: new method `to_file()` for more convenient saving Solution object to json or yaml files. (@kirill-push)
- `Solution`: new method `from_file()` for more convenient loading Solution object from json or yaml files. (@kirill-push)
- `Solution`: new classmethod `from_preset()` to `replace pyEQL.functions.autogenerate()` and instantiate a solution from a preset composition. (@kirill-push)

### Changed

- `Solution`: method af adjusting diffusion coefficients for temperature was updated (same as used in PHREEQC >= 3.4)
- `Solution.conductvity`: improved equation (same as used in PHREEQC >= 3.4) which is more accurate at higher concentrations

### Fixed

- Database errors with `Cs[+1]` diffusion coefficient and `KBr` Pitzer parameters
- Restored filter that suppresses duplicate log messages

### Deprecated

- `replace pyEQL.functions.autogenerate()` is now deprecated. Use `from_preset` instead.

### Removed

- The `activity_correction` kwarg in `get_transport_number` has been removed, because this now occurs by default and is
  handled in `get_diffusion_coefficient`.

## [0.9.2] - 2023-11-07

### Fixed

- Restored filter that suppresses duplicate log messages

## [0.9.1] - 2023-11-04

### Added

- `format_solutes_dict()` method added into the utils module to help format solutes dictionaries with a unit. (@DhruvDuseja)

### Changed

- Native property database is now instantiated on `pyEQL.__init__` to speed subsequent access by `Solution`
- Numerous performance optimization increased the speed of many `Solution` property and method calls by 3x-10x

## [0.9.0] - 2023-10-17

### Added

- `Solution.print()` added to take the place of the deprecated `list_xxx` methods.

### Changed

- **Breaking** `pyEQL.unit` deprecation machinery has been removed to quiet the warning
  messages on import. The `pyEQL` unit registry was renamed to `pyEQL.ureg` in v0.6.1.
- Significant documentation updates.
- `Solution.components` is now automatically sorted in descending order of amount, for
  consistency with `anions`, `cations`, and `neutrals`.

### Removed

- `Solution.list_solutes()` has been removed. Use `Solution.components.keys()` instead.

### Fixed

- Bugfix in `as_dict` to make serialization via `dumpfn` possible. Previously, `Quantity`
  were not converted to a serializable form. Now, `Quantity` are converted to `str` in
  `as_dict()`.

### Removed

- python 3.8 is no longer supported

## [0.8.1] - 2023-10-01

### Changed

- `from_dict` modified to avoid call to `super()`, making for more robust behavior if `Solution` is inherited.

### Removed

- `copy()` method was removed for consistency with `python` conventions (it returned a deep rather than a
  shallow copy). Use `copy.deepcopy(Solution)` instead.

### Fixed

- Bugfix in `as_dict` in which the `solutes` attribute was saved with `Quantity` rather than `float`
- Simplified `Solution.get_conductivity` to avoid errors in selected cases.
- Required `pymatgen` version was incorrectly set at `2022.8.10` when it should be `2023.8.10`
- Bug in `get_osmotic_coefficient` that caused a `ZeroDivisionError` with an empty solution.

## [0.8.0] - 2023-09-27

### Added

- New electrolyte engine `PhreeqcEOS` provides `phreeqpython` activities within `pyEQL`
- `Solution`: use total element concentrations when performing salt matching (can be disabled via kwarg)
- `Solution`: add speciation support to the native engine via `phreeqpython`
- `Solution`: add keyword argument to enable automatic charge balancing
- `Salt`: class is now MSONable (i.e., serializable via `as_dict` / `from_dict`)
- `Solution`: new properties `anions`, `cations`, `neutrals` provide easy access to subsets `components`.
- `Solution`: improvements to `get_total_amount`.
- `Solution`: new function `get_components_by_element` that lists all species associated with elements in specific
  oxidation states.
- `Solution`: new properties `elements` and `chemical_system`, new function `get_el_amt_dict` to compute the total
  number of moles of each element present in the Solution.

### Changed

- `pH` attribute is now calculated from the H+ concentration rather than its activity. For the old behavior,
  use `Solution.p('H+')` which defaults to applying the activity correction.
- Update `test_salt_ion_match` to `pytest` format and add additional tests
- Update `test_bulk_properties` to `pytest` format

### Removed

- `Solution.list_salts()` has been removed. See `Solution.get_salt_dict()` for equivalent functionality
- `salt_ion_match.generate_salt_list` and `identify_salt` have been removed. See `Solution.get_salt_dict()` and `Solution.get_salt()` for equivalent functionality.

### Fixed

- Bug in `get_transport_number` caused by migration to standardized solute formulas
- Scaling of salt concentrations in `get_salt_dict` was incorrect in some edge cases
- Disable hydrate notation in `standardize_formula`, which caused hydroxides such as 'Ca(OH)3' to be written 'CaO2H.H2O'
- Inconsistent formatting of oxidation states in `get_total_amount` and `Solute`
- Inconsistent return type from `get_property` when `molar_volume` and `diffusion_coefficient` were missing
- Two issues with the formatting of the `H2O(aq)` entry in the database, `pyeql_db.json`

## [0.7.0] - 2023-08-22

### Changed

- `Solution` now more robustly converts any user-supplied formulas into unique values using `pymatgen.core.ion.Ion.reduced_formula`. This means that the `.components` or `solvent` attributes may now differ slightly from whatever is entered during `__init__`. For example, `Solution(solvent='H2O').solvent` gives `H2O(aq)`. This behavior resolved a small bug that could occur when mixing solutions. User supplied formulas passed to `get_amount` or `Solution.components[xxx]` can still be any valid formula. E.g., `Solution.components["Na+"]`, `Solution.components["Na+1"]`, and `Solution.components["Na[+]"]` will all return the same thing.

## [0.6.1] - 2023-08-22

### Added

- `Solution`: enable passing an `EOS` instance to the `engine` kwarg.
- `Solution`: new properties `total_dissolved_solids` and alias `TDS`
- `Solution`: support new units in `get_amount` - ppm, ppb, eq/L, etc.
- `Solution`: implemented arithmetic operations `+` (for mixing two solutions), `*` and `\` for scaling their amounts

### Changed

- `pyEQL.unit` was renamed to `pyEQL.ureg` (short for `UnitRegistry`) for consistency with the `pint` documentation and tutorials.

## [v0.6.0] - 2023-08-15

### Added

- `Solution`: add tests to confirm that solution density changes with temperature and pressure
- `Solution`: add tests for `charge_balance`, `alkalinity`, `hardness`, `osmotic_pressure`, `p()`, and `conductivity`
- `Solution`: `pE` attribute and kwarg
- `Solution`: add support for passing solutes as a `dict`
- Implement extensible system for connecting `Solution` to various activity and speciation
  models. Models can be integrated into pyEQL by implementing an `EOS` class. The desired
  activity model is selected on init. Currently available models are `native` (for pyEQL's
  implementation of Pitzer, which decays gracefully into Debye-Huckel and other models if
  parameters are not available) or `ideal` for a dummy engine that returns unit activity
  coefficients. Support for additional external engines such as [`phreeqpython`](https://github.com/Vitens/phreeqpython) is planned.
- Add `pymatgen`, `monty`, and `maggma` as dependencies
- Add `pre-commit` configuration
- Add pull request template, new GitHub actions, and `tox -e autodocs` environment to serve and update docs in real time
- Add pre-commit configuration and lint with `ruff` using rulesets mostly borrowed from `pymatgen`
- Add more comprehensive platform testing via `tox`

### Changed

- Complete overhaul of the property database. The database is now distributed in a .json file containing serialize `Solute` objects. `Solution` can now be connected to this database (by default) or to any other `maggma` `Store` containing properly formatted data. `database.py`, `parameter.py`, and all the `.tsv` data files have been removed and replaced with `pyeql_db.json`.
- Docs: update, change theme, convert to .md format, and adopt Keep a Changelog format
- Replace `water_properties.py` with [iapws](https://github.com/jjgomera/iapws) package
- Replace `elements.py`` with `pymatgen.core.periodic_table`
- `Solution.charge_balance` now returns in equivalents instead of Coulombs
- Migrate all tests to `pytest`
- Update packaging format to use [pyscaffold](https://pyscaffold.org/en/stable/index.html)

### Deprecated

- `Solution`: new properties `pressure`, `temperature`, `volume`, `pH`, `mass`, `density`, `viscosity_dynamic`, `viscosity_kinematic`, `ionic_strength`, `conductivity`, `debye_length`, `bjerrum_length`, `alkalinity`, `hardness`, `dielectric_constant`, `osmotic_pressure`, `solvent_mass`, `charge_balance` have replaced the corresponding get_XXX and set_XXX (for temperature and pressure) methods, which will be removed in a future release. `get_viscosity_relative` will be removed entirely.
- `Solute`: methods `get_formal_charge()`, `get_name()`, and `get_molecular_weight()` have been
  replaced by direct access to the attributes `charge`, `formula`, and `mw`, respectively.

### Removed

- disable 'verbose' kwarg in `get_activity` and `get_activity_coefficient`
